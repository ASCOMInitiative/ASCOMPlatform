/*
 * Note: the reader may wonder why the lock() statement was not used to protect the UpdateList collection.
 * This is because the threading model of a WinForms app makes it possible to get into a deadlock situation.
 * Our timer tick event marshalls updates onto the GUI thread, and for reasons I don't fully understand,
 * this causes deadlock, particularly in the Visual Studio designer, which hangs Visual Studio.
 * 
 * So, an alternative strategy was used. The Add and Remove methods execute within a finally block, making them
 * contrained regions, i.e. the code is atomic and cannot be interrupted. There is a danger here in that an exception within a finally()
 * block can cause the process to abort, so this code is kept deliberately simple and should not pose a problem here.
 * 
 * In the timer tick event, the UpdateList collection is cloned before iterating over the clone. This could mean
 * that some of the referenced objects could be disposed during an update cycle, and it is possible that an object may receive
 * one update even after it has unregistered from the CadenceManager. For this reason, updates are protected in a
 * try/catch block. Any exception causes the object to be permanently removed from the UpdateList.
 * CadenceManager expects that the objects it manages will ocaationally throw exceptions, for example if they've been
 * disposed. If this happens, then that control will stop updating, but that's probably what was intended anyway.
