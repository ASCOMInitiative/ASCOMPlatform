<h1>Meade Classic and Autostar I Driver</h1>

<p>The Meade ASCOM driver is compatible with all Meade scopes except the RCX-400 
and LX200GPS/R. Separate ASCOM drivers exist for the RCX-400 and LX200GPS/R 
scopes. </p>
<p>This Meade driver is actually two drivers in one. It contains both a 
Telescope driver as well as a Focuser driver (since the scope and focuser 
controls share the same serial port). The telescope driver conforms to the ASCOM Telescope V2 specifications. 
The focuser driver conforms to the initial (and only release at this time) of 
the ASCOM focuser specification.&nbsp; For more information about ASCOM, see the <a href="http://ASCOM-Standards.org/" target="aux">ASCOM web site</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Which">Which Meade driver should I use?</a></h2>

<p>There are as many as four Meade type drivers that are being supported at this 
time:</p>
<ul>
	<li><font color="#FFFF00">Generic LX200 Type Scopes</font> - not for use on 
	true Meade scopes.&nbsp; Many other telescopes have used control approaches 
	based on the Meade protocols.&nbsp; This driver is for them.</li>
	<li><font color="#FFFF00">Meade RCX-400</font> - this is exclusively for the 
	Meade RCX400 scopes.</li>
	<li><font color="#FFFF00">Meade LX200 GPS/R</font> - this is exclusively for 
	the Autostar II Meade LX200GPS and LX200R scopes.</li>
	<li><font color="#FFFF00">Meade Classic and Autostar I </font>- this is the 
	proper driver for most other Meade scopes.&nbsp; (Classic LX200, old style 
	GEMs, Autostar I).&nbsp; It supports telescope and focuser functionality at 
	the same time.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="T-Setup"></a>Telescope setup</h2>

<p>The setup window (which is probably open now) allows you to adjust settings for your scope and your needs. There are two mandatory settings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">COM Port</span> - This must be set to the COM port number on which your scope is connected.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">The 16&quot; classic checkbox</span> - You must turn this on if you have a 16&quot; Classic. <i class="y">Do not turn this on if you have a 16&quot; LX200GPS!</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional settings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Auto Set Time (Classic only)</span> - If set, then the driver will set the scope time to the computer time on connect.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Auto Unpark / Track (Classic only)</span> - If set, the driver will unpark 
	and set tracking to true on connect (this is the old V1 behavior, and is 
	available for backwards compatibility).&nbsp; The Autostar I always comes up unparked and tracking.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Beep at slew completion</span> - The computer will beep (as well as the handbox) on completion of a slew.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Delay After Sync</span> - The driver will wait for 5 seconds after a SYNC before returning control to the program. This is useful mainly 
	with automation programs such as ACP Observtory Control Software which do things rapidly. It allows the scope some time to complete the sync and give the correct (after-sync) coordinates back to the program. Leave this off unless your software is having problems immediately after a SYNC.</li>
	<li><font color="#FFFF00">German Equatorial (GEM)</font> - If your mount is 
	a GEM style mount, then check this box.&nbsp; The driver will report such to 
	higher level software which can then manage pier side details.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Max Slew Speed</span> - This sets the maximum rate at which your scope will slew. This speed is internally limited by the driver to a setting of 3 for the Classic (to protect the scope in automated use). You can set a lower speed if you wish.&nbsp; Putting "A" into the box is supported, and this will cause the driver to automatically set the fastest safe speed depending on your scope model.&nbsp; In addition, putting an "N" into the box will completely bypass the slew speed setting in the driver, leaving your handbox setting. <span style="color: black; background: yellow">WARNING! Setting too high a slew speed may result in damage to your scope's nylon gears. It is recommended that you use the speed setting support in the driver!</span> This is not supported on the Autostar I (495/497).</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Elevation, Aperture diameter, Aperture Area, and Focal length</span> - Some programs use this info to calculate the field of view, exposure time estimates, etc. You should fill these in. <i>Be careful to note the units of measure!</i></li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Set Park Position (Classic only)</span> - While connected, slew the scope to the position at which you want to have it park and turn tracking off. Then click this button.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Reset Park Position (Classic only)</span> - See <a href="#T-Parking">Parking</a> (Classic section) below.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="T-Model"></a>Model specifics</h2>

<h3>Classic LX200 (8&quot;, 10&quot;, and 12&quot;)</h3>

<p>The Classic LX200 (except the 16&quot;) can have a park position remembered when used in the Northern hemisphere. Defects in the Meade firmware prevent other cases from working at this time. Firmware 3.34 or later (4.34 in the 12&quot;) are supported. Earlier firmware versions will likely not work at all. If you have an older LX200 Classic, try the Generic LX200 driver and set the encoder resolution to 0.5 arc minutes.</p>

<h3>16&quot; Classic</h3>

<p>The arbitrary park position is not supported due to firmware limitations. The 16&quot; checkbox <i>must</i> be turned on in the setup window or slewing will not work properly.</p>

<h3>Autostar I #494 and #495</h3>

<p>The Autostar I #494 an #495 must be powered-up and completely aligned (using 
the handbox) before connecting from the software. The Autostar 
I 494 an 495 cannot be unparked. After a Park command is completed, the software must be disconnected and telescope power must be cycled before normal operation can continue. Tracking state (on/off) cannot be controlled. The scope is always tracking when connected.</p>

<h3>Autostar I #497</h3>

<p>The Autostar I #497 must be powered-up and completely aligned (all motions 
and initializations complete) before connecting from the software. The Autostar 
I #497 can not be unparked. After a Park command is completed, the software must 
be disconnected and telescope power must be cycled before normal operation can 
continue. Tracking state (on/off) can be controlled if the most up to date 
firmware is installed.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="T-Parking"></a>Parking</h2>

<p>The purpose of parking a scope is to allow a <i>stationary</i> scope to be powered up at a later time and not have to be synced or otherwise aligned. This does not apply to the Autostar I (#494, #495, 
and #497) which must always be aligned using the handbox before connecting the software.</p>

<p>For polar aligned scopes there is a default/natural Park Position.&nbsp; For the Classic, the park position is at the meridian and 0-dec for polar mounted scopes and 0 alt 180 az for alt/az mounted scopes. These two are actually the same mechanical position relative to the base of the scope. </p>

<p>The driver is supports alternate park positions for the Classic, but the 
implementation is complex.&nbsp; If <b>you have any parking problems start by clicking the "Reset Park Position" button in the setup window</b>.

<h3>LX200 Classic 8&quot;, 10&quot;, and 12&quot; only!</h3>

<p>The driver allows the Park Position to be changed. Once it is set, it is remembered across sessions. You don't have to set it again, unless you want to change to a new Park Position. If you don't explicitly set the Park Position, the driver will assume the default wake up position. If you power-up the scope from a different position (say from manually moving the scope axis while off), then the scope will be lost, and manual sync to the sky will be required.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To change the Park Position (default is 0 HA, 0 Dec):
  <ol>
    <li>Make sure the scope coordinates are &quot;right&quot;. In the day time you can position the scope to 0 HA, 0 Dec before turn on, or at night you can sync to any object in the sky.</li>
    <li>Position your scope at the desired Park Position. Tracking state on / off does not matter.</li>
    <li>Use one of the various [Set Park] buttons in your application software or the button in the 
	driver setup window.&nbsp; Set park has a few quirks:<ul style="margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 6pt">
  <li>It will be an error to set park position anywhere in the &quot;wakeup&quot; zone.	When the LX200 Classic wakes up, it hunts for a worm start position. We need to disambiguate simple disconnect / reconnect from true cold start. The wake up zone is defined as about a degree from the 0 
	Hour Angle, 0 Declination point. Set park is best used when the park position is a long way from the 0, 0 point.</li>
	<li>Southern hemisphere is not supported for set park.&nbsp; Regular parking 
	continues to work fine.</li>
</ul>

	</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To Park:
  <ol>
    <li>Use the [Park] command found in your software. You cannot simply move the scope to a position and turn it off. You must use a Park command. Then, do not move the scope or release the RA or Dec clutches until Unpark or connect with auto-unpark.</li>
    <li>Power down if desired.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To Unpark:
  <ol>
    <li>Power up the scope if needed. Do not move it.</li>
    <li>Connect with your software. If AutoTrack is enabled, you're done.</li>
    <li>If no AutoTrack, then press Unpark.</li>
    <li>You may need to turn on tracking as well.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The Meade focuser is a &quot;relative&quot; focuser, and therefore the Position 
	Property is not implemented.</li>
