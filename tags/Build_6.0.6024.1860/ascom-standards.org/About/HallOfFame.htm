		<h3>ASCOM Hall of Fame</h3>
		<p>Many  people have participated significantly by writing drivers and tools, providing useful information, and helping with interface agreements, etc. The following people have made particularly significant contributions to the ASCOM Initiative. </p>
		<h4>Core Platform Developers</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li><span class="underline">Peter Simpson</span> - <span class="note">Our lead developer and engineer</span>. For almost all of Platform 5.5, his clear-headed engineering approach to  strategic Platform issues, the <i>absolutely vital</i> driver conformance checker, and for doing <span class="underline">most of the work on Platform 6</span>. His contributions are just too numerous to list here, suffice it to say that Peter is our lead developer and deserves all of our undying gratitude!</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Tim Long</span> - For all of his work setting up and hosting the <a href="../Community/Index.htm#opnsrc" target="_blank">open-source engineering and build environment</a>, pushing forward with .NET, establishing our weekly online platform meetings, writing drivers and tools, helping with .NET issues, and being a moderator for the ASCOM Talk group. Tim has brought software development discipline to the team, and supplied the tools with which we maintain same.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Rob Morgan</span> - For work on the <a href="../Developer/ClientToolkit.htm" target="_blank">.NET Client Toolkit</a>, the .NET driver templates for Visual Studio, lots of research and prototyping on the .NET interfaces and now they map to other languages outside of .NET, and a fair bit of documentation for the Platform.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Chris Rowland</span> - For developing the  incredibly complex Celestron unified driver, Apogee camera drivers, the Camera V2 simulator, Camera test tools, the final scheme for supporting multiple-instance devices, and always providing clear and unwavering advice and counsel.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Chris Norman</span> - A recent addition, Chris is a Microsoft employee whose &quot;day job&quot; involves quality control, testing and certification. His expertise has already helped us to bring out a better product in Platform 6.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Jordan Schaenzle</span> - Software Engineeer, Optec, Inc. For diving into .NET based driver and tool development head first, providing valuable real-time feedback from a &quot;learning mode&quot; driver developer, contributing to the local server evolution, and much more.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Others (in no particular order)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="underline">Tom Andersen and Ted Leckie</span> - For seeing the logic in ASCOM and the driver/client architecture back in 1998, and providing a grant to develop the first set of drivers and simulators.  </li>
			<li><span class="underline">Doug George</span> - For &quot;getting it&quot;  back in 1999 and adding a non-trivial scripting interface to MaxIm DL immediately thereafter. He also authored the Camera, Focuser, and FilterWheel driver standard interfaces, basing them on real-world experience with MaxIm.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Larry Weber and Steve Brady</span> - for their fabulous <a href="http://www.focusmax.org/" target="_blank">FocusMax</a> autofocus software, evangelizing ASCOM as being <span class="underline">absolutely necessary</span> for FocusMax's success, and for driving the Focuser standard.  </li>
			<li><span class="underline">Chris Peterson</span> - For being a very knowledgeable curmudgeon, keeping us honest, and helping people with concise and correct information. Chris' participation in (and inputs to) our weekly meetings have been invaluable.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Jonathan Fay</span> - For the <a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/" target="_blank">Worldwide Telescope</a> which puts Microsoft behind ASCOM and for the original .NET Client Toolkit that provides .NET client software with automatic easy access to late-bound drivers.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Jeff Dickerman</span>, president of Optec, Inc. - For having the vision and commitment to provide factory-developed drivers for all of their equipment. </li>
			<li><span class="underline">Mark Crossley</span> - For the FilterWheel Simulator and his helpful inputs during shakeout of the FilterWheel spec. </li>
			<li><span class="underline">David Challis</span> - For believing in ASCOM strongly and making  Quantum Scientific cameras  ship with factory-supplied drivers. </li>
			<li><span class="underline">Jon Brewster</span> - For developing several drivers and simulators, the  Meade drivers, POTH, Pipe/Hub, and generally being a guiding light. He even went to Meade one time to get the &quot;low down&quot; for the Meade drivers. His crystal-clear headed approach to engineering was a great help on many occasions. </li>
			<li><span class="underline">John Oliver</span> - For his work on the dome geometry code used in POTH and by several other programs, and for his role in the Dome interface agreement. </li>
			<li><span class="underline">Tim Cann</span> - President of Chronos, Inc. For believing in ASCOM and shipping his harmonic drive mounts with a factory ASCOM driver.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Dan Azari</span> - For authoring the original Rotator interface, and for RCOS shipping factory-supplied drivers for their Focuser and Rotator. </li>
			<li><span class="underline">Joe Shuster</span> - For quietly doing the lion's share of moderating the ASCOM-Talk forum, and being a clear-headed engineer with a great head for interface negotiation and design. </li>
			<li><span class="underline">Jim Moronski</span> - For having Finger Lakes Instruments cameras ship with factory-supplied drivers </li>
			<li><span class="underline">Ray Gralak</span> - For the excellent ASCOM drivers and tools that ship with Astro-Physics products, and for his other programs that use ASCOM drivers.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Chris Houghton</span> - For shipping Astrometric Instruments telescope control systems with factory-supplied drivers </li>
			<li><span class="underline">Ajai Sehgal</span> - For putting a ton of work into the early Astro-Physics and Gemini drivers, and supporting them in the face of firmware changes beyond his control. He was a pioneer with arrows in his back.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Stef Cancelli</span> - For the graphical and logic design of this ASCOM web site. It might not seem that way, but it took a lot of his time to do it.</li>
			<li><span class="underline">Peter Eschman</span> - For the original Driver Checker tool. This started the discipline of rigorous testing of drivers.</li>
			<li> <span class="underline">Bob Denny</span> - For many things... </li>
