	<h1>Creating Installers for your Drivers</h1>

	<p>Starting with ASCOM Platform 2008 (Platform 5), drivers (apart from simulators and some 
	hub-type tools) are not included with the Platform itself. This means that 
	driver developers must now furnish their drivers as separately installable 
	packages. We&#39;ve made this free and relatively easy. The Platform includes an optional 
	tool that generates a first-cut of an installer script for the free
	<a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php" target="aux">Inno Setup</a> 
	installer package. Also included are graphics that will give your driver&#39;s 
	installer a consistent look and feel, important for end users&#39; comfort and 
	confidence. Here&#39;s a brief step by step:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/download.php/is.exe">Download Inno 
	Setup</a> and install it on your system.</li>
	<li>Open the Inno Setup help file and get at least a bit of familiarity with 
	the script layout and compilation process. Every minute spent here will save 
	you far more than a minute later!</li>
	<li>Run the &quot;Driver install script maker&quot; (Start menu, ASCOM Platform, 
	Tools).</li>
	<li>Fill in the form that appears (see tips below).</li>
	<li>Click Save. The Inno Setup compiler will appear showing your driver&#39;s 
	install script. <strong>Check it out</strong>!</li>
	<li>Make any adjustments needed (<em>it&#39;s only a starting point!</em>).</li>
	<li>Compile it and test the installer within Inno Setup. Here&#39;s a checklist:<ol type="a">
		<li>Driver goes into correct Common Files\ASCOM subfolder</li>
		<li>It is properly registered for COM (use 
		<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=5233b70d-d9b2-4cb5-aeb6-45664be858b6&amp;DisplayLang=en" target="aux">OLEView</a>)</li>
		<li>If it is a local server (EXE) type, it has correct AppID info (use 
		<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=5233b70d-d9b2-4cb5-aeb6-45664be858b6&amp;DisplayLang=en" target="aux">OLEView</a>)</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>The installer generator also creates a simple test script (JScript).</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Look at the test script in Notepad. Make any adjustments needed (<em>it&#39;s 
		a starting point!</em>).</li>
		<li>Double-click it. You should see a popup with your driver&#39;s name.
		</li>
		<li>Next you should see your driver&#39;s setup dialog.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Finally, use some ASCOM client to show a Chooser for your driver type 
	and verify that your driver is listed.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips on Making Install Packages</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Please do not change the installer graphic. It&#39;s important for end 
		users to have a consistent experience when installing ASCOM drivers.</li>
		<li><span class="underline">Use a unique name for your driver&#39;s Read Me file</span> (not just &quot;ReadMe.html&quot;). 
		Failure to do this will probably cause your ReadMe to overwrite another 
		or get overwritten by another ReadMe from someone else who failed to give theirs a unique name.</li>
		<li>The Source path should point to the project folder for your driver. For .NET assembly/DLL drivers, the tool assumes that the driver DLL is located below this folder in ..\bin\Release.</li>
		<li>The browse buttons for the main driver file and Read Me file will be 
		enabled after you browse to the source location of your driver&#39;s files.</li>
		<li>If your driver is a .NET assembly (in-proc DLL) type, you can browse 
		down to bin\Release to locate the DLL file. Any other place will cause 
		the script generator to fail.</li>
		<li>If your driver is a .NET local server (exe), you will need to add a 
		Source statement to the script for the driver DLLs that go into the xxxServedClasses folder.</li>
		<li>If your driver is a VB6/C++ COM local server (exe) you will have to 
			add the needed registry commands to create the AppID (DCOM) info if you 
			want it to be usable from Software Bisque&#39;s TheSky. Details are in the 
			developer section of the <a href="http://ascom-standards.org/" target="aux">ASCOM Web Site</a>.</li>
		<li>The script generator is not a&nbsp; &quot;womb to tomb&quot; solution. You 
		will almost certainly have to make adjustments to the resulting Inno 
		Setup (.iss) script. </li>
		<li>The script (.iss) file and the compiled installer package will be 
		put into the Source folder you select.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>How it works (advanced developers)</h2>
	<p>The generator uses the info from its form fields to make substitutions 
	into a <em>template</em> script file, then writes the result into your 
	script (.iss) file. The template is located in the Resources subfolder below 
	the script generator&#39;s folder (nominally Program Files\ASCOM\Install Script 
	Gen). There is a document describing the substitution tokens in the script 
	generator&#39;s installation folder. </p>
