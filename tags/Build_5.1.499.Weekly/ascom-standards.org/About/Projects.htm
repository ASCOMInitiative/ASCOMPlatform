		<h3>Projects in Progress</h3>
		<h4>Weather Safety Interface</h4>
		<p>With the variety of weather stations out there, and their different interfaces, it seems natural that astronomy applications should have the benefit of a driver layer to make  weather safety information available without coding for every station out there. This project has become active, with Matt Thomas leading the way with an interface proposal. The present effort is aimed at providing safe/unsafe and basic sky condition inputs. It looks like providing detailed meterological information may become a separate project. </p>
		<h4>Switch Interface    </h4>
		<p>This driver interface provides device-independent access to switch closures. There are many typoes of electrical switch systems that can be controlled by computers, and they interface through a variety of hardware connections (serial link, ethernet, USB). Astronomy applications often to need to control power and other things via computer-controlled switches. Switch has been defined by Jon Brewster, who also developed the Switch Simulator that is included in the ASCOM Platform. This spec is at the point of adoption by poll. The ASCOM Platform 5 already has the proposed interface and a simulator, and Peter Simpson's Conform tool will test switch drivers for conformance. </p>
		<h4>ASCOM-X</h4>
		<p>ASCOM should be cross-platform rather than just for Windows. Drivers with the current standard APIs should be available to programs on the Mac and on Linux. Clearly, the same driver can't run on all three platforms. But the driver-client model can be implemented on the other platforms, including the current ASCOM standard driver APIs. The problem is daunting, though, because any driver layer on those platforms really should be <span class="underline">language-independent</span> as it is on Windows. How do you make a driver layer language-independent on Mac and Linux? This is being discussed on a separate Yahoo! Group <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ASCOM-Cross/" target="aux">ASCOM-Cross</a>. </p>
