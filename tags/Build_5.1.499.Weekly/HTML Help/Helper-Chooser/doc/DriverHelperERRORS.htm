The various objects served by the DriverHelper raises trappable errors when they cannot continue their current operation. The Contents tab of this document lists the error messages sorted alphabetically (under Error Messages) and the Index tab lists them by hexadecimal code (under Error Codes). Clicking on either of these entries leads to a page with a brief description of the error condition.

<p>Error codes are Automation/ActiveX compatible 32-bit values, based on FACILITY_ITF (a.k.a. vbObjectError for VBA) with an offset of 400 hex, and are thus compatible with all ActiveX scripting languages, Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), etc. it is imperative that drivers raise Automation errors with values equal to 80040400 hex and higher.
