	<h1>Master Interfaces and Binding</h1>

	<p>Starting with Platform 5, master interfaces are installed in a registered COM type library and a .NET 
	primary interop assembly (in the GAC). 
	There are several purposes for including these interfaces:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Make it easier for client developers to use drivers by eliminating 
		the complexities of reflection and late binding.</li>
		<li>Provide automatic enforcement of standards compliance to driver 
		writers, helping them to ensure their drivers really implement the 
		standards.</li>
		<li>Provide development environment assistance to both client and driver 
		writers via interface implementation tools and IntelliSense or the 
		equivalent in their IDE.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="style1">Today's drivers were developed according to the original 
	ASCOM late-binding rule, so they each define their own interfaces that <em>
	should</em> contain all of the members (properties and methods) specified in 
	the standard. Clients cannot bind to these per-driver interfaces as they are 
	unique to each driver. Instead, they are required to reflect (inspect at run 
	time) on the drivers' interface members, knowing only the member name, then 
	invoking the member via a generic function. This is called <em>late-binding. 
	At</em> the time of inception of ASCOM, this made perfect sense, as it kept 
	the association between clients and drivers loose.</p>
	<p>It is now a goal of ASCOM to have drivers not only support late binding, 
	but also expose a <em>generic</em> or <em>master</em> interface for the 
	driver type to permit interface-based <em>early-binding</em>. This is 
	possible in most languages and development systems including VB6 (the 
	technique was not evident until recently). It is beyond the scope of this 
	article to explain interface-based programming or the techniques for 
	exposing a master interface in all of the various programming languages and 
	systems that support COM. Rather, it provides reference information for the 
	most common language that will permit the programmer to reference the 
	correct items in their development environment. Here is a table of the 
	interface names and the standards they represent.</p>
	<table align="center" cellpadding="5">
		<tr>
			<td>ICamera</td>
		<td>ASCOM Camera Interface V1.0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IDome</td>
		<td>ASCOM Dome Interface 1.0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IFilterWheel</td>
		<td>ASCOM FilterWheel Interface 1.0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IFocuser</td>
		<td>ASCOM Focuser Interface 1.0</td>

	<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"><img src="tip.gif" alt="Note" width="23" height="32" hspace="6" align="left">The 
	.NET templates provided in the Platform developer content already have the 
	correct references set. <br>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Master Type Library for COM</h2>
	<p>For VB6, Delphi, and C++/ATL, a <em>registered</em>
	<span class="underline">master type library</span> is provided. Its name is 
	AscomMasterInterfaces.tlb. It appears in the&nbsp; OLEView type library tree 
	and the VB6 References selector list as &quot;ASCOM Master Interfaces for .NET 
	and COM (V1.0)&quot;. Any time you are writing a new driver or converting an 
	existing one to dual early/late binding, this is the reference to use for 
	the interfaces.</p>
	<p>You may notice the two Helper type libraries while viewing in OLEView or 
	the VB6 references list. Ignore these, they are used by the .NET reference 
	assemblies (see the next section). Instead, reference Helper and Heper2 
	directly. They have always supported early/late binding.</p>
	<h2>Master Interface Assembly for .NET</h2>
	<p>For .NET, a registered master primary interop assembly (PIA) is provided. 
	It appears in the .NET References window, COM tab, as &quot;ASCOM Master 
	Interfaces for .NET and COM (V1.0)&quot; (the same friendly name as seen in COM 
	from OLEView etc.). Once referenced in a .NET project, it will show as 
	ASCOM.Interfaces, the namespace containing the interfaces (e.g. 
	ASCOM.Interface.ITelescope). </p>
<h2>Helper PIAs</h2>
	<p>In addition, two additional PIAs are provided for the Helper and Helper2 
	components. They appear in the .NET references window, COM tab, as &quot;ASCOM 
	Helper Interfaces for .NET (V1.0)&quot; and &quot;ASCOM Helper2 interfaces for .NET 
	(V1.0)&quot;. They are provided because setting a reference directly to Helper or 
	Helper2 causes two more references (IScriptingSafety and ScriptingRuntime) 
	to be needlessly dragged into the projects that use these components. 
	Neither are used in the .NET environment.</p>
