	<h1>Using the Templates</h1>

	<p>You chose to have the driver and local server templates included the ASCOM Platform 2008 installation. Before using the templates, there are a few things you <em>really</em> need to understand.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"><img src="tip.gif" alt="Note" width="23" height="32" hspace="6" align="left">While the templates handle many tricky details (namespaces, GUIDs, ProgID, etc.), successful use requires that you understand the information provided here. It is assumed that you have at least a moderate level of skill using C# or VB and Visual Studio 2005. Please take a few moments to go through this information, it will probably save you a great deal of time and frustration. </p>
	<h2>Installing the Templates</h2>
	<p>Before using the templates, <span class="underline">you must first install them</span> into your Visual Studio 2005/2008 environment. Locate the file C:\Program Files\Common Files\ASCOM\.net\ASCOMDriverTemplates.vsi andd double-click it. This should start the Visual Studio Content Installer. Follow the wizard's directions. You can answer Yes to the &quot;No signature found&quot; window that appears, the content is safe! If you already have templates installed, you'll see a popup asking you what to do. <span class="underline">Answer &quot;Overwrite existing tempate&quot;</span>. </p>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Driver templates for Visual Studio 2005 are provided for Dome, Focuser, Rotator, and Telescope, in both C# and VB. These templates are not usable in earlier versions of Visual Studio or stand-alone. The drivers produced from these templates are <em>in-process</em> drivers; they are loaded into the process space of the client application. Only one application can be connected to the device via the driver at a time. A local server template is also provided, and is described below. </p>
	<p>ASCOM drivers written in .NET are COM objects just like all other ASCOM drivers. Thus, they are known by their driver ID (ProgID), the name used to create an instance of a driver. By convention, drivers developed in .NET have ProgIDs of the form ASCOM.<em>device-name</em>.<em>driver-type</em>, for example ASCOM.MeadeRCX.Telescope. Similarly, the assembly name for drivers is of the form ASCOM.<em>device-name</em>.<em>driver-type</em>.dll, for example ASCOM.MeadeRCX.Telescope.dll. The namespace for drivers is ASCOM.<em>device-name</em>, for example ASCOM.MeadeRCX. The driver contains a class <em>driver-type</em>, for example, Telescope, that implements the standard interface for the driver-type of the driver.</p>
	<p>The ASCOM Platform installs a Primary Interop Assembly (PIA) that contains the definitions of all of the standard ASCOM driver interfaces. The templates automatically include a reference to these interfaces and a <span class="code">using</span> or <span class="code">Imports</span> statement which makes it unnecessary to use fully-qualified names to access the interface definitions. You'll notice that the template automatically includes the appropriate interface in the <em>driver-type</em> class, indicating that the class implements that interface, for example, <span class="code">class Telescope : ITelescope</span> (C#) and <span class="code">Class Telescope Implements ITelescope</span> (VB). </p>
	<p>The fact that the drivers implement a master interface makes it possible for clients to <em>early-bind</em> to them. Not all ASCOM drivers currently implement the master interfaces, so in general, clients will late-bind to drivers. However, it is hoped that eventually all drivers will support both early- and late-binding, at which time clients will be able to use the drivers with much simpler code. In addition, the discipline of implementing a master interface ensures that drivers really do implement the complete interface, and with the correct property and method signatures. </p>
	<h2>Project Name</h2>
	<p>When you use the New Project command in Visual Studio, you see the New Project window which contains icons for the types of projects you can create. After installing the templates, in the My Templates areas you can see the ASCOM Driver templates. After choosing the <em>type</em> of driver you wish to create, and before clicking OK, you are required to enter a project name. As you'll see in the 1-line description that appears when you click one of the driver template icons, the choice of project name is very important! The things that derive from the project name are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The ProgID of your driver: ASCOM.<em>project-name</em>.<em>driver-type</em>. For example a telescope driver with a project name of AstroPhysics will result in a driver with a ProgID of ASCOM.AstroPhysics.Telescope.</li>
		<li>For C# drivers, the namespace will be ASCOM.<em>project-name</em>. For VB drivers, you'll be instructed to change the root namespace to ASCOM.<em>project-name</em>. Either way, the result will be a <em>driver-type</em> class within this namespace, resulting in a fully qualified name for the class of, you guessed it, ASCOM.<em>device-name</em>.<em>driver-type</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Typically, then, the project name you choose should be just the device name of the instrument your driver is intended to provide access to. Here are some more examples:</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"><img src="tip.gif" alt="Note" width="23" height="32" hspace="6" align="left"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>:<span class="underline"> Do not include spaces or punctuation such as underscores, hyphens, and of course periods, in your project name</span>. They are illegal in ProgIDs and strongly discouraged in .NET namespace names. Leaving a space in the project name when creating the project will result in an underscore in the actual project name, again illegal. Also there is a <span class="underline">39-character limit to the length of ProgIDs</span>, so choose your project name such that the ProgID will not exceed this limit. </p>
	<h2>Local Server Template</h2>
	<p>This template implements an ASCOM host server for one or more driver classes in a single-instance executable. It can be used to serve multiple instances of a single driver class (hub) or for providing driver services for multiple devices (e.g., Telescope and Focuser) to multiple applications. In the latter scenario, the multiple driver classes will often share one or more resources such as the serial connection and a microcontroller in the combined device. From the client's perspective, using the drivers served by the local server is exactly the same as if the drivers are loaded into the client's process space (in-proc servers). </p>
	<p>Successfully completing a local server requires a higher level of skill in .NET compared to an in-proc server. You should have at least some familiarity with the C# language because the local server itself is implemented in C#. The drivers that it serves, however, may be developed in either C# or VB using the in-proc driver templates described above. They are dynamically loaded by the local server, which is responsible for registering, activating, the unregistering them. However, if the driver classes served by the local server require access to common resources (such as a shared serial port), the common resources need to be declared in the SharedResources class of the local server itself. This is written in C#. .NET does not permit mixing languages within a single project.</p>
	<h2>Local Server Project Name</h2>
	<p>When one or more drivers are served by a local server, it is the <span class="underline">local server's project name</span> that is important. For example, you are writing a driver for the Meade LX200GPS. Both telescope and focuser control uses the same serial line. Therefore, you need a local server which serves a Telescope driver and a Focuser driver, sharing a single DriverHelper.Serial object for serial line communication. Your choice of project name for the <em>local server</em> determines the device-name part of the ProgID. Continuing our example, choosing LX200GPS as the project name for the local server results in the following ProgIDs for the served drivers:</p>
	<p class="code">ASCOM.LX200GPS.Telescope</p>
	<p class="code">ASCOM.LX200GPS.Focuser</p>
	<p>The driver projects that you'll add after creating the local server project can have any project name; you'll be instructed on how to change their namespaces (and other small changes) as needed to be served by the local server. </p>
