    // but won't actually be added to the movie.

    // set ShowDialog to true and specify the parent window. If opts is non-NULL and its
    // dwFlags property includes AVICOMPRESSF_VALID, then opts will be used to give initial
    // values to the dialog. If opts is non-NULL then the chosen options will be placed in it.

    // in 'opts' is used, and there's no need to call GotAviVideoCompression afterwards.
