<h1>Meade Telescope &amp; Focuser Driver 4.1.14 </h1>

<p>The Meade ASCOM driver is compatible with <i>all</i> Meade scopes except the RCX-400. A separate ASCOM driver for the RCX-400 is currently undergoing testing (August 2006). </p>
<p>This Meade driver is actually two drivers in one. It contains both a Telescope driver as well as a Focuser driver (since the scope and focuser controls share the same serial port). The telescope and focuser drivers both conform to the ASCOM Telescope V2 specifications. For more information about ASCOM, see the <a href="http://ASCOM-Standards.org/" target="aux">ASCOM web site</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Which">Which Meade driver should I use?</a></h2>

<p>You may have noticed that there are two Meade drivers listed in the Telescope Chooser: <em>Meade LX200 and Autostar</em> and <em>Meade Telescope and Focuser</em>. If you are a new user, it's suggested that you use the <i class="y">Meade Telescope and Focuser</i> selection, as this provides independent access to the telescope and focuser by different programs. The other one is provided for backwards compatibility.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="T-Setup"></a>Telescope setup</h2>

<p>The setup window (which is probably open now) allows you to adjust settings for your scope and your needs. There are two mandatory settings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">COM Port</span> - This must be set to the COM port number on which your scope is connected.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">The 16&quot; classic checkbox</span> - You must turn this on if you have a 16&quot; Classic. <i class="y">Do not turn this on if you have a 16&quot; LX200GPS!</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional settings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Auto Reboot/Init (LX200GPS only)</span> - If set, and if no initial response is receives from the scope, the driver will initiate an Autostar II reboot sequence. This will allow a parked (and possibly power-cycled) LX200GPS to be  initialized/aligned without touching the handbox. The reboot sequence can take up to 4 minutes, and will take a minimum of 2 minutes to detect if there is no scope connected at all. See <a href="#T-LX200GPS">Using the LX200GPS</a>.
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Auto Set Time (Classic &amp; LX200GPS only)</span> - If set, then the driver will set the scope time to the computer time on connect. Required for hands-off startup of the LX200GPS.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Auto Unpark / Track (Classic &amp; LX200GPS only)</span> - If set, the driver will unpark and set tracking to true on connect (this is the old V1 behavior, and is available for backwards compatibility). The Autostar II (LX200GPS) cannot be unparked, but the tracking state on connect is still controlled by this option. The Autostar I always comes up unparked and tracking.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Beep at slew completion</span> - The computer will beep (as well as the handbox) on completion of a slew.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Delay After Sync</span> - The driver will wait for 5 seconds after a SYNC before returning control to the program. This is useful mainly with the LX200GPS and automation programs which do things rapidly. It allows the scope some time to complete the sync and give the correct (after-sync) coordinates back to the program. Leave this off unless your software is having problems immediately after a SYNC.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Max Slew Speed</span> - This sets the maximum rate at which your scope will slew. This speed is internally limited by the driver to a setting of 5 for the LX200 GPS and 3 for the Classic (to protect the scope in automated use). You can set a lower speed if you wish. Putting "A" into the box is supported, and this will cause the driver to automatically set the fastest safe speed depending on your scope model (GPS or Classic). In addition, putting an "N" into the box will completely bypass the slew speed setting in the driver, leaving your handbox setting. <span style="color: black; background: yellow">WARNING! Setting too high a slew speed may result in damage to your scope's nylon gears. It is recommended that you use the speed setting support in the driver!</span> This is not supported on the Autostar I (495/497).</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Elevation, Aperture diameter, Aperture Area, and Focal length</span> - Some programs use this info to calculate the field of view, exposure time estimates, etc. You should fill these in. <i>Be careful to note the units of measure!</i></li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Set Park Position (Classic only)</span> - While connected, slew the scope to the position at which you want to have it park and turn tracking off. Then click this button.</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Reset Park Position (Classic only)</span> - See <a href="#T-Parking">Parking</a> (Classic section) below.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="T-Model"></a>Model specifics</h2>

<h3>LX200GPS (Autostar II)</h3>

<p>Autostar II firmware versions 3.0i and later are supported. The Autostar II cannot be unparked by the driver. After a Park command is completed, the <em>software</em> must be disconnected. It is possible, however, to (re)connect to a parked (and <i>optionally</i> power-cycled) LX200GPS and bring it back online without interaction with the handbox. <span style="color: yellow">See <a href="#T-LX200GPS">Using the LX200GPS</a> below.</span> The Auto Unpark/Track option controls the initial state of tracking; the Autostar II cannot be unparked by the driver. GuideRateDeclination and GuideRateRightAscension are tied together, and can be no larger than 15.0417 &quot;/sec.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> When you upgrade from firmware 3.0i to 4.0h, you must power-on, align, then park the scope using the handbox one time. This firmware upgrade alters the Smart Drive behavior, and existing PEC data must be converted to the new format. You should see a special "fingerprinting" phase on the handbox during this initial power-up.</p>

<h3>Classic LX200 (8&quot;, 10&quot;, and 12&quot;)</h3>

<p>The Classic LX200 (except the 16&quot;) can have a park position remembered when used in the Northern hemisphere. Defects in the Meade firmware prevent other cases from working at this time. Firmware 3.34 or later (4.34 in the 12&quot;) are supported. Earlier firmware versions will likely not work at all. If you have an older LX200 Classic, try the Generic LX200 driver and set the encoder resolution to 0.5 arc minutes.</p>

<h3>16&quot; Classic</h3>

<p>The arbitrary park position is not supported due to firmware limitations. The 16&quot; checkbox <i>must</i> be turned on in the setup window or slewing will not work properly.</p>

<h3>Autostar I (#495 and #497)</h3>

<p>The Autostar I must be powered-up and completely aligned (using the handbox) before connecting from the software. The Autostar I cannot be unparked. After a Park command is completed, the software must be disconnected and telescope power must be cycled before normal operation can continue. Tracking state (on/off) cannot be controlled. The scope is always tracking when connected.</p>

<hr>
<a name="T-LX200GPS"></a><h2>Using the LX200GPS</h2>

<p>The Meade driver supports tracking on/off control and hands-off startup of the LX200GPS. The latter feature is vital for remote imaging, and very handy for any permanently mounted LX200GPS. If you park your scope after each use, you will never have to hand-slew to a star and sync again. Upon connecting from your software, the scope will be aligned and ready for use. <span style="color: yellow">The Auto Reboot/Init option in the driver's setup window must be activated for this feature to work!</span></p>
<h3>Portable or casual use</h3>

<p>If you move your scope or disengage the RA or Dec clutches, then you must power up and align your scope with the handbox <i>before</i> connecting from your software. </p> 

<h3>Permanently mounted LX200GPS</h3>

<p>If your scope is permanently mounted on a pier, <span class="Underline">and if you never release the RA or Dec clutches</span>, then you can avoid the need for manual alignment and/or hand-syncing. This driver has special features that allow it to initialize a <a href="#T-Parking">parked</a> LX200GPS from a cold-start (park, power-cycle, connect) or a warm-restart (park and reconnect without power-down). Again, the scope must be parked for auto-startup to work! In order for this to work, there are a few Autostar II handbox settings that <i>must</i> be made <i>once</i>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Enter your Site information (including the <span class="Underline">standard time</span> UTC offset) for your scope's location.</li>
	<li>Turn OFF Daylight Savings(!) Your handbox will always show <span class="Underline">standard time</span>. This is essential! </li>
	<li>Turn OFF the Sun Warning (3.0i firmware only).</li>
	<li>Under Setup/Telescope select:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Mount: Polar or Alt/Az. Recommended: POLAR (use a wedge for permanent use!) </li>
			<li>GPS Alignment: OFF</li>
			<li>If your mount is polar mounted, Home Sensors: OFF </li>
			<li>Park Position (Default or Current, see Meade Manual). Recommended :DEFAULT </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color: yellow">Now park your scope with the handbox!</span></li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, <span style="color: yellow">the Auto Reboot/Init option in the driver's setup window must be activated for this feature to work!</span></p>

<p>Once you have done the above, or any time you park the scope, you may power it down or leave it powered up with the "Scope parked..." message showing. In the latter state, all motors are off and the scope will not respond to commands from the handbox or the serial line. Thus you can leave the scope powered up without wear on the motors or the risk of tracking into the pier, cord wrap, etc.</p>

<p style="color: black; background: yellow;">For many versions of the LX200GPS firmware, the CCD guider socket is atill active when "Meade PARKed". Any input on that socket when the handbox is displaying "Scope parked... Turn Off scope" causes a FULL SPEED SLEW. The current version (4.0i) is safe with regard to the CCD socket in that state (there are monents whenit is not).</p>

<p>When you want to use the scope again, depending on whether you left it powered up or not, do one of the following:</p>

<ol type="A">
	<li>Power on the scope and wait until it shows the Daylight Savings prompt, <i>then</i> connect from the software.</li>
	<li>If the power is on (showing "Scope is parked..." on the handbox), simply connect from the software.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2><a name="T-Parking"></a>Parking</h2>

<p>The purpose of parking a scope is to allow a <i>stationary</i> scope to be powered up at a later time and not have to be synced or otherwise aligned. This does not apply to the Autostar I (#495/#497) which must always be aligned using the handbox before connecting the software.</p>

<p>For polar aligned scopes there is a default/natural Park Position at 0 Hour Angle (on the Meridian), and 0 Declination. For Alt / Az scopes, the default is at 0 Altitude, 180 degrees Azimuth (pointing due South). These two sky positions translate to the same mechanical position of the scope. The LX200 GPS and Classic scopes can be set up for other park positions. See the applicable section below.</p>

<h3>LX200GPS Only</h3>

<p>You can park the scope from the software or the Autostar II handbox. The park position can be changed using the Autostar II handbox only. It is not necessary to power down the scope after parking; the driver can warm-reboot the Autostar II resulting in a ready-to-use aligned scope.</p>

<h3>LX200 Classic 8&quot;, 10&quot;, and 12&quot; only!</h3>

<p>The driver allows the Park Position to be changed. Once it is set, it is remembered across sessions. You don't have to set it again, unless you want to change to a new Park Position. If you don't explicitly set the Park Position, the driver will assume the default wake up position (previous paragraph). If you power-up the scope from a different position (say from manually moving the scope axis while off), then the scope will be lost, and manual sync to the sky will be required.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To change the Park Position (default is 0 HA, 0 Dec):
  <ol>
    <li>Make sure the scope coordinates are &quot;right&quot;. In the day time you can position the scope to 0 HA, 0 Dec before turn on, or at night you can sync to any object in the sky.</li>
    <li>Position your scope at the desired Park Position. Tracking state on / off does not matter.</li>
    <li>Use one of the various [Set Park] buttons in your application software or the button in the setup window.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To Park:
  <ol>
    <li>Use the [Park] command found in your software. You cannot simply move the scope to a position and turn it off. You must use a Park command. Then, do not move the scope or release the RA or Dec clutches until Unpark or connect with auto-unpark.</li>
    <li>Power down if desired.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To Unpark:
  <ol>
    <li>Power up the scope if needed. Do not move it.</li>
    <li>Connect with your software. If AutoTrack is enabled, you're done.</li>
    <li>If no AutoTrack, then press Unpark.</li>
    <li>You may need to turn on tracking as well.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Set park has a few quirks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It will be an error to set park position anywhere in the &quot;wakeup&quot; zone.	When the LX200 Classic wakes up, it hunts for a worm start position. We need to disambiguate simple disconnect / reconnect from true cold start. The wake up zone is defined as about a degree from the 0, 0 point. Set park is best used when the park position is a long way from the 0, 0 point.</li>
</ul>
