            The declination tracking rate (arcseconds per second, default = 0.0)
            This property, together with RightAscensionRate, provides support for "offset tracking".
            Offset tracking is used primarily for tracking objects that move relatively slowly against the equatorial coordinate system.
            It also may be used by a software guiding system that controls rates instead of using the PulseGuide() method. 
            NOTES:
            The property value represents an offset from zero motion. 
            If CanSetDeclinationRate is False, this property will always return 0. 
            To discover whether this feature is supported, test the CanSetDeclinationRate property. 
            The supported range of this property is telescope specific, however, if this feature is supported,
            it can be expected that the range is sufficient to allow correction of guiding errors caused by moderate misalignment and periodic error. 
            If this property is non-zero when an equatorial slew is initiated, the telescope should continue to update the slew destination coordinates at the given offset rate.
            This will allow precise slews to a fast-moving target with a slow-slewing telescope.
            When the slew completes, the TargetRightAscension and TargetDeclination properties should reflect the final (adjusted) destination.
            This is not a required feature of this specification, however it is desirable.

            NOTES:

            Writing to this property is optional. Often, a telescope (or its driver) calculates refraction using standard atmospheric parameters.
            If the client wishes to calculate a more accurate refraction,
            then this property could be set to False and these client-refracted coordinates used.
            If disabling the telescope or driver's refraction is not supported,
            the driver must raise an error when an attempt to set this property to False is made.

            (possibly uncorrected for atmospheric refraction) for "here and now",

            The most common is the Julian Epoch 2000 (J2000). 
            These instruments apply corrections for precession,
            nutation, abberration, etc. to adjust the coordinates from the standard system

            The right ascension tracking rate offset from sidereal (seconds per sidereal second, default = 0.0)
            This property, together with DeclinationRate, provides support for "offset tracking".
            Offset tracking is used primarily for tracking objects that move relatively slowly
            against the equatorial coordinate system. It also may be used by a software guiding
            system that controls rates instead of using the PulseGuide() method.
            NOTES:
            The property value represents an offset from the current selected TrackingRate. 
            If this property is zero, tracking will be at the selected TrackingRate. 
            If CanSetRightAscensionRate is False, this property must always return 0. 
            To discover whether this feature is supported, test the CanSetRightAscensionRate property. 
            The property value is in in seconds of right ascension per sidereal second. 
            To convert a given rate in (the more common) units of sidereal seconds
            per UTC (clock) second, multiply the value by 0.9972695677 
            (the number of UTC seconds in a sidereal second) then set the property.
            Please note that these units were chosen for the Telescope V1 standard,
            and in retrospect, this was an unfortunate choice.
            However, to maintain backwards compatibility, the units cannot be changed.
            A simple multiplication is all that's needed, as noted. 
            The supported range of this property is telescope specific, however,
            if this feature is supported, it can be expected that the range
            is sufficient to allow correction of guiding errors
            caused by moderate misalignment and periodic error. 
            If this property is non-zero when an equatorial slew is initiated,
            the telescope should continue to update the slew destination coordinates 
            at the given offset rate. This will allow precise slews to a fast-moving 
            target with a slow-slewing telescope. When the slew completes, 
            the TargetRightAscension and TargetDeclination properties should
            reflect the final (adjusted) destination. This is not a required
            feature of this specification, however it is desirable.

        <member name="M:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.Halt">
            <summary>
            Immediately stop any focuser motion due to a previous Move() method call.
            Some focusers may not support this function, in which case an exception will be raised. 
            Recommendation: Host software should call this method upon initialization and,
            if it fails, disable the Halt button in the user interface.

        <member name="M:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.Dispose">
            <summary>
            Dispose the late-bound interface, if needed. Will release it via COM
            if it is a COM object, else if native .NET will just dereference it
            for GC.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.Absolute">
            <summary>
            True if the focuser is capable of absolute position; that is, being commanded to a specific step location.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.IsMoving">
            <summary>
            True if the focuser is currently moving to a new position. False if the focuser is stationary.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.Link">
            <summary>
            State of the connection to the focuser.
            et True to start the link to the focuser; set False to terminate the link. 
            The current link status can also be read back as this property. 
            An exception will be raised if the link fails to change state for any reason.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.MaxIncrement">
            <summary>
            Maximum increment size allowed by the focuser; 
            i.e. the maximum number of steps allowed in one move operation.
            For most focusers this is the same as the MaxStep property.
            This is normally used to limit the Increment display in the host software.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.MaxStep">
            <summary>
            Maximum step position permitted.
            The focuser can step between 0 and MaxStep. 
            If an attempt is made to move the focuser beyond these limits,
            it will automatically stop at the limit.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.Position">
            <summary>
            Current focuser position, in steps.
            Valid only for absolute positioning focusers (see the Absolute property).
            An exception will be raised for relative positioning focusers.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.StepSize">
            <summary>
            Step size (microns) for the focuser.
            Raises an exception if the focuser does not intrinsically know what the step size is.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.TempComp">
            <summary>
            The state of temperature compensation mode (if available), else always False.
            If the TempCompAvailable property is True, then setting TempComp to True
            puts the focuser into temperature tracking mode. While in temperature tracking mode,
            Move commands will be rejected by the focuser. Set to False to turn off temperature tracking.
            An exception will be raised if TempCompAvailable is False and an attempt is made to set TempComp to true.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.TempCompAvailable">
            <summary>
            True if focuser has temperature compensation available.
            Will be True only if the focuser's temperature compensation can be turned on and off via the TempComp property.

        <member name="P:ASCOM.DriverAccess.Focuser.Temperature">
            <summary>
            Current ambient temperature as measured by the focuser.
            Raises an exception if ambient temperature is not available.
            Commonly available on focusers with a built-in temperature compensation mode.
