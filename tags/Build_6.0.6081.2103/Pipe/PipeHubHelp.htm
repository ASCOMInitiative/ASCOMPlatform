<h1><span lang="en-gb">Pipe And Hub Information</span></h1>
<p><span lang="en-gb">A &quot;hub&quot; is an ASCOM tool for allowing multiple programs to 
connect to ASCOM drivers that would otherwise only work with a single program.&nbsp; 
The &quot;Hub&quot; hub is the simplest such program.&nbsp; Hub goes to a lot of trouble 
to do nothing but pass through commands exactly as they are given.&nbsp; It just 
mediates access for multiple programs. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb">Pipe is also a hub.&nbsp; It can be used instead of the 
&quot;Hub&quot; hub as an ASCOM linkage debugger.&nbsp; Pipe is a hub that can be 
inserted in between any two or more ASCOM components so that the traffic between these 
components can be monitored.&nbsp; Pipe goes to a lot of trouble to do nothing but 
log traffic and pass through commands exactly as they are given. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="en-gb">Simple Usage</span></h2>
<ol>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">Select &quot;Hub&quot; or &quot;Pipe&quot; from the client chooser</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">From the Hub or Pipe setup dialog choose Device(s)</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">Close Hub or Pipe setup dialog and connect to devices via the 
	client programs</span></li>
</ol>

<h2><span lang="en-gb">What Hub does:</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">It is an ASCOM &quot;hub&quot; for telescope, dome, and focuser 
connections in any combination.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span lang="en-gb">What Hub does not do:</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">Hub has no &quot;handset&quot; like GUI window.&nbsp; It is 
	just a hub.&nbsp; For a handset GUI use POTH.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span lang="en-gb">What Pipe does:</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">It is an ASCOM &quot;hub&quot; for telescope, dome, and focuser 
connections in any combination.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">Logs ASCOM commands and responses to a window and a 
	file for diagnostic evaluation.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">Errors raised from the driver (whatever Pipe is 
	connected to) will also be displayed and logged, before being passed up to 
	the client (whatever has connected to Pipe). </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span lang="en-gb">What neither Pipe nor Hub do:</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">They do not precondition commands as they pass 
	through.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">They do not test for and correct error 
	conditions.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">They do no dome slaving or focuser temperature 
	compensation</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span lang="en-gb">More complex things to do with Pipe</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">There are control checkboxes on the main window for 
	selecting sets of interesting commands.&nbsp; They can be toggled at any 
	time.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">There are [Connect] buttons for manually connecting 
	to the desired drivers (as specified in the set-up dialog), or the client 
	software 
	can be left to do all connect operations.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">The logged data shows up in a scrolling area of the 
	main Pipe window.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">There is a [Mark] button for inserting a “Mark” into 
	the log for later discovery.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">There is a log file kept in the directory that 
	Pipe.exe is found. By default, this is “C:\Program Files\Common 
	Files\ASCOM\Telescope”. Each time Pipe is run it copies Pipe.log to Pipe.bak 
	and restarts Pipe.log at zero length. While the displayed log in the main 
	window throws away the older entries as it goes, the log file contains the 
	entire session.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">There is a [Clear] button that will zero the current 
	log file and clear the logging window. Clear will not copy the existing log 
	to Pipe.bak. </span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">There is an Enable/Disable button that allows 
	temporary suspension of logging.&nbsp; ASCOM commands will still be passing 
	through.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">If the [Advanced] button in the setup dialog is used to expose the advanced 
area, and a given driver is connected, then the capabilities area will be filled 
out for review. This will require Pipe to generate and send a series of requests 
to the drivers. None of these values can be changed.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Programmers Information</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">Errors raised from the driver (whatever Hub or Pipe 
	is connected to) will also be passed up to the client (whatever is connected to Hub 
	or Pipe).&nbsp; Pipe will also log the errors.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">Both support early and late binding from clients.&nbsp; 
	For late bindings, the &quot;Name&quot; property will return &quot;Pipe-&gt;(driver name)&quot;.&nbsp; 
	For early bindings, the &quot;Name&quot; property will return &quot;I_Pipe-&gt;(driver name)&quot;.&nbsp; 
	The &quot;I&quot; feature will likely be dropped after sufficient early binding 
	testing by the ASCOM comunity.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="en-gb">Both support early and late binding to drivers.&nbsp; 
	Early binding will be attempted first, classic ASCOM late binding will 
	attempted as fall back.&nbsp; Late binding can be forced for test purposes 
	by putting a registry entry into Hub or Pipe's ASCOM registry area as &quot;ForceLate&quot;.&nbsp; 
	ForceLate would be a string set to &quot;True&quot;.</span></li>
</ul>
