	<h1>ASCOM Platform 2008 (v5.0)</h1>

	<p>Congratulations, you successfully installed the ASCOM Platform 2008 (v5.0), the foundation technology for astronomical instrument  <i>drivers</i>. The ASCOM Platform is a set of components that support ASCOM-compliant astronomical instrument drivers. It also contains optional content for <a href="#devel">developers of drivers and programs</a> which use those drivers.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; background-color: #FFFF00;"><img src="tip.gif" alt="Note" width="23" height="32" hspace="6" align="left">If you have upgraded from an earlier ASCOM Platform release (4.1 or earlier) please read <a href="#whatsnew">What's New?</a> below. If you are a developer please read the <a href="#devel">Important Information for Developers</a> section below. </p>
	<h2>How to Get Drivers  </h2>
	<p>The ASCOM Platform  does not include the drivers themselves. If your instrument didn't come with a driver, first try contacting the manufacturer and see if a driver has become available. If they don't offer one, then go to the <a href="http://ascom-standards.org/" target="browser">ASCOM Initiative web site</a>, navigate to the Downloads page, and see if a driver is available there. Many drivers have been written by third party volunteers who have  programming skills and also own an instrument for which there is no driver. These drivers are posted on the ASCOM web site free for use. Failing that, consider joining the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ASCOM-Talk/" target="browser">ASCOM Talk group</a>, which you can visit on the web or subscribe to via email. </p>
	<h2>What Is a Driver?</h2>

	<p>Well, step back from astronomy for a minute. When you go out and buy a printer, you can be virtually certain that it will work with <em>all</em> of the programs on your computer. Likewise, when you install a new program on your computer, you can be virtually certain that it can print to your existing printer, even if it's no longer in production. We take this for granted. Printers come with a disk that installs the <em>driver</em> for the printer. The driver takes care of all of the details for that particular printer, leaving all of your Windows programs with a common printer-agnostic way to send pages to paper. </p> 

	<p>OK, back to astronomy. Until ASCOM, each astronomy program that needed to control telescopes, focusers, and so forth had to include <em>its own code</em> for all of the different instrument types out there. Keeping up with new instruments, supporting old ones, and dealing with firmware revisions is a tremendous burden. You're probably used to asking questions like</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Does BeautifulSky support my mount?<br>
Does CCD Master support my mount?<br>
Does AlignWizard support my mount?<br>
Does <em>whatever</em> support my mount? (get the picture?) </p>
	<p>ASCOM eliminates this problem for you. Most programs that need to control telescopes, focusers, etc., now expect a <em>driver</em> to be available for those instruments. For example, you may have several programs that need to control your telescope (planetarium, imaging software, alignment assistance tool). If there is a driver for your mount, you can be virtually certain that all of these programs can control it. So now the only question you have to ask, for now and for the future is</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Does my mount come with a driver or is there one available?</p>

	<p>You ask one question of your mount maker, not many questions of all of your software suppliers. Please let your instrument makers know how important it is for their products to ship with drivers. After all, the driver is a critical part of their customers' experiences! </p>
	<h2><a name="whatsnew"></a>What's New? </h2>
	<p><a name="FLI"></a>
	Starting with the ASCOM Platform 2008, drivers are no longer included in the Platform. There are just too many drivers out there, and they are revised too often, to keep re-releasing the Platform for every driver change. The installer for ASCOM Platform 2008 has left your existing drivers in place and removed all traces of any earlier Platform installation. Please read <a href="#uninstall">Uninstalling Drivers</a> below. The  driver developers are adding installers for the individual drivers. </p>
	<p>The other significant addition to the ASCOM Platform 2008 is support for Microsoft's .NET development platform. Drivers will continue to use the same operating system service (COM) as always, so today's drivers will continue to be compatible with today's and tomorrow's programs. What's been added is a set of tools that standardize and facilitate access by .NET programs to ASCOM drivers, and a set of templates and support components that standardize the structure and facilitate development of ASCOM drivers written in .NET. If you are developer, please visit the Developers section of the <a href="http://ascom-standards.org/" target="browser">ASCOM web site</a>! </p>
	<h2><a name="uninstall"></a>Uninstalling Drivers </h2>
	<p>Uninstalling an individual driver was not an option with earlier Platform releases, and this is still true. <span class="underline">Do not simply remove driver files!</span> The operating system will continue to think the driver is installed, and the Chooser will still show it listed. This can lead to program failures if the ghost driver is selected. Until the transition to separately installed drivers is complete, leave existing drivers as is. Once a new version of the driver is available, with its own installer, you'll be able to use the uninstall feature for that driver to remove it safely. </p>
	<h2><a name="devel"></a>Important Information for Developers</h2>
	<p>If you are a developer interested in writing software that controls astronomical instruments, or writing a driver for a particular instrument, please go to the <a href="http://ascom-standards.org/">ASCOM Initiative web site</a> and look over the <span class="underline">developer information</span> we've provided there. In addition, before using the VS.NET 2005 driver templates, it's very important that you look over <a href="Templates.html">Using Templates</a>. 
	This platform contains new master interfaces for all ASCOM driver types, as well as the Helper and Helper 2 components. Regardless of the language you use, please look over 
	<a href="Interfaces.html">Master Interfaces and Binding</a>. Finally, we've 
	provided tools with which driver developers can create their own 
	self-contained setup programs for their drivers.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; background-color: #FFFF00;"><img src="tip.gif" alt="Note" width="23" height="32" hspace="6" align="left">As 
	a developer, it's important to keep up with the evolution of the technology 
	underlying your work. Please take a bit of time to look at the new <a href="http://ascom-standards.org/">ASCOM Initiative web site</a> 
	in the Developers section, and read the other papers linked above. It will 
	save you time in the future, and assure that your driver(s) and client(s) 
	put their best foot forward! </p>
