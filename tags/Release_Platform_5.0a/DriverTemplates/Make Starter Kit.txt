To make a starter kit:

(1) Create a template and export it. It will end up in My Exported Templates

(2) Unzip it to some temp folder, preserving folders

(3) Edit the .vstemplate file and add to the ProjectItem tag for readme.htm OpenInWebBrowser="true"

(4) Edit the .vstemplate file and change the DefaultProjectName to "YourNameHere" and MOST IMPORTANTLY ProvideDefaultName to false!

(5) Re-zip and replace the template zips IN BOTH PLACES (exported and VS templates!)
