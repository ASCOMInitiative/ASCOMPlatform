The 'Master Build' contains three significant Solution Configurations (targets):
1. Debug - builds components in debug mode
2. Release - builds components with optimization enabled
3. Platform Dependencies - builds the Platform Dependencies folder in debug mode.

Build Process
=============

The platform build is automatic and is currently performed by TeamCity build server.

Platform Releases
=================

A platform release can be made by simply copying a tagged build from the
tags folder of the ASCOM SVN repository. The TeamCity build server will
have a build configuration that builds the entire platform and creates a
labelled build in the tags folder. This build process can be started from the
TeamCity web interface by any member of the Platform Release Managers group.

Platform Dependencies
=====================

The purpose of the Platform Dependencies folder is to provide a staging area
for the core components that driver and simulator developers may reference
during development. This is needed because those developers do not necessarily
have permission to access the entire SVN repository.

Building the Platform Dependencies target builds the core assemblies (in Debug
configuration) and copies the outputs to the Platform Dependencies folder, from
whence they may be committed to Subversion. Driver developers will pick up those
updates the next time they do an SVN Update.

Driver and Simulator Development
================================

When developing a new driver or simulator, developers should reference components
in the Platform Dependencies folder. Do not reference components installed in the
Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

Driver and Simulator setup projects should NOT redistribute core components. The
Platform components will be installed in the GAC by the Platform Installer. The
driver/simulator will then automatically detect and use those components.
