	<h3>Distributing the ASCOM Platform</h3>
	<p>Think of the ASCOM Platform as analogous to Apple's QuickTime for Windows. As time goes on, more and more programs will use the ASCOM Platform, and you can expect more and more of your customers to already have it installed. The Platform Installer will be maintained by the ASCOM Initiative as an open source project. It will be downloadable from the ASCOM web site.</p>
		
	<p>This leaves you with a couple of choices: 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Embed the ASCOM Platform installer within your installer and run it as part of your setup process
		<li>Keep the ASCOM Platform installer separate, asking your users to run it separately
	</ul>
	
	Your first reaction to this is probably "Oh I don't want my users to install <i>two</i> things!" Ok, but consider <i>these</i> things: 
	<ol>
		<li>The installer is 5+ megabytes in size.
		<li>As time goes on, more and more of your customers will already have it installed.
	</ol>
	
	<p>Would you embed the Apple QuickTime for Windows installer in your installer? Why or why not? Give the above some thought and make a heads-up decision. We don't insist that you keep it separate, but there are some compelling reasons to do so.
