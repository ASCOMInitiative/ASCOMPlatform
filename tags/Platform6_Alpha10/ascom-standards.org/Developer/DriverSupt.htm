		<h3>Dealing With  Support Issues</h3>
		
		<p>Driver support involves three or four people:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Driver author</li>
			<li>Client application author</li>
			<li>The user with the problem</li>
			<li>Driver supporter (often the driver author)    </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Driver authors need to design the driver so it can be supported easily. Things that help with this are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ensure that no unexpected errors can happen. Unsupported errors are almost invariably fatal and can be very cryptic.</li>
			<li>Provide meaningful error messages. These help enormously in determining what is happening. Just trapping the generic errors and reporting them with information about where they happen is very useful.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Client application developers need to catch the driver errors and report them accurately. A generic error report can lose all the information provided by the driver author. It's a good idea to put all calls to the ASCOM driver in a try ... catch structure or the equivalent.</p>
		<p>The users need to be encouraged to report details and repro scenarios. 
		See the <a href="../Support/Index.htm">Support page</a>.
		<p>Now its down to the driver supporter and the user. A driver supporter needs to be patient; many users aren't computer literate, few will be literate in ASCOM. None of them have your knowledge of the driver. Patience is a virtue. </p>
