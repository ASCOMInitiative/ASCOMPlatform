	<remarks>
 Parity is an error-checking procedure in which the number of 1s must always be the 
 same — either even or odd — for each group of bits that is transmitted without error. 
 Parity is one of the parameters that must be 
 agreed upon by both sending and receiving parties before transmission can take place.

	<summary>
 The Chooser object provides a way for your application to let your user select the telescope to use.
 </summary>
	<remarks>
		<para>Calling Chooser.Choose() causes a chooser window to appear, with a drop down selector list containing all of the registered Telescope 
 drivers, listed by the driver's friendly/display name. The user sees a list of telescope types and selects one. 
 Before the OK button will light up, however, the user must click the Setup button, causing the selected driver's setup dialog to appear 
 (it calls the driver's Telescope.SetupDialog() method). When the setup dialog is closed, the OK button will light and allow the user 
 to close the Chooser itself.</para>
		<para>The Choose() method returns the DriverID of the selected driver. Choose() allows you to optionally pass the DriverID of a "current" 
 driver (you probably save this in the registry), and the corresponding telescope type is pre-selected in the Chooser's list. In this case, 
 the OK button starts out enabled (lit-up); the assumption is that the pre-selected driver has already been configured. </para>
