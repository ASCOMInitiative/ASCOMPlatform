	<h3>The ASCOM Standards Process</h3>
	<p>The ASCOM standards process is  <i>informal </i> since relatively few people are involved and the astronomy community overall is relatively small. By avoiding the stilted and often political &quot;standards body&quot; approach, standards can be proposed, discussed, implemented, tested, refined, and accepted by vote more quickly and with a higher probability of success. See <a href="#philosophy">Philosophical Issues</a> below. Loosely stated, the process is:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A <span class="underline">single author</span> publishes  a draft interface specification. Ideally, this will be derived from an interface already in use and not designed in a vacuum.  See <a href="#philosophy">Philosophical Issues</a> below.</li>
		<li>Discuss the proposal on ASCOM-Talk until an interface agreement can be reached. See <a href="#philosophy">Philosophical Issues</a> below. </li>
		<li>Implement a simulator which has all of the properties and methods of the proposed interface (a reference implementation). Ideally this would be done by someone other than the author. Make the simulator available to anyone who wishes to play with it.</li>
		<li>Refine the specification and simulator as dictated by experience, again reaching an interface agreement brokered by the author. Discussion is closed at this point. </li>
		<li>The author  posts a poll on ASCOM-Talk, giving the community several weeks to vote yes or no. Further suggestions and other feedback will be rejected at this point. </li>
		<li>If the majority votes yes, the specification is considered &quot;adopted &quot; and <span class="underline">the author is responsible for writing the final standard document</span>. If not, either go back to step 4 or drop the spec entirely and possibly start over. </li>
	</ol>

		<h3>Philosophical Issues </h3>
	<h4>Real-World Designs</h4>
	<p>The most important goal of the standards process is to avoid the &quot;design and decree&quot; process that has caused so many failures and financial damage in the past. Typically employed by academics, design-and-decree just plain doesn't work. Professional engineers know it's essential to prototype, refine, and plan to throw the first one away or maybe start over.</p>
	
	<h4>Interface Agreements</h4>
	<p>Another important aspect of the standards process is that the author is  responsible for brokering the interface agreement, a difficult task requiring sensitivity and above all the strength to reject &quot;it would be nice if&quot; suggestions which have no clear use-case. </p>
