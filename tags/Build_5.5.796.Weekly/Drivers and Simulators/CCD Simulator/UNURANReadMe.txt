UNURAN -  Universal Non-Uniform RANdom number generators

UNU.RAN (Universal Non-Uniform RAndom Number generator) is a collection of algorithms for generating non-uniform pseudorandom variates as a library of C functions designed and implemented by the ARVAG (Automatic Random VAriate Generation) project group in Vienna, and released under the GNU Public License (GPL). http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

It is especially designed for such situations where:
    * a non-standard distribution or a truncated distribution is needed.
    * experiments with different types of distributions are made.
    * random variates for variance reduction techniques are used.
    * fast generators of predictable quality are necessary.

Within the ASCOM Camera simulator, UNURAN is used to create the image background noise when the show stars option is selected.
