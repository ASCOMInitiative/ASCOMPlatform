To make a C# template:

(1) Create a template from CSharpBase template

(2) Change the project name to xxxTemplate (DO NOT INCLUDE SPACES IN TEMPLATE NAME!)

(3) Add a reference to the relevant ASCOM interface assembly

(4) Implement the interface in Driver.cs (use smart tag)

(5) Move existing SetupDialog impementation into alphabetic order within the IXxxx Members region

(6) Replace in files "DeviceName" with $safeprojectname$ CURRENT PROJECT ONLY!!!

(7) Same replacement separately in ReadMe.txt

(8) Fix up the test script

(9) In AssemblyInfo.cs, replace GUIDSUBST with $guid1$

(10) In Driver.cs, replace GUISDSUBST with $guid2$

(11) Change throw statements generated by implement interface to use ASCOM not implemented exceptions

(11) Add //TODO comments on each implemented prop and meth

Now export this project as a template, then use it to make a final driver project. It must compile with no editing!
