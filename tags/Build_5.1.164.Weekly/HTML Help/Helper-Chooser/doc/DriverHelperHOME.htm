<h2>Introduction</h2>

This document describes the five objects served by the ASCOM Telescope Driver Helper component ("Helper"). The Helper component is supplied as part of the ASCOM Telescope Driver Software Development Kit. It may be redistributed freely with telescope drivers developed using the SDK and with the pre-written drivers that also come with the SDK. 

<div class=note>We strongly encourage you to use the Helper objects wherever possible. A small investment in reading the sources of the pre-written drivers that come with the SDK will pay off in the long run. The pre-written drivers demonstrate the advantages and simplicity gained by using the Helper objects.</div>

<p>The five objects served by the Helper component (and their ProgIDs) are:

<dl>

<dt><b><a href="DriverHelperCLASSChooser.htm">DriverHelper.Chooser</a></b>
<dd>Provides an easy to use "telescope chooser" window from which your users can select the telescope (and thus the driver) to use. Includes a setup button that forces your users to perform detup tasks for the chosen driver. All you need is to Call Choose() and get back the DriverID of the driver to use.

<dt><b><a href="DriverHelperCLASSProfile.htm">DriverHelper.Profile</a></b>
<dd>Provides a way to register and unregister telescope drivers for listing in the Chooser, as well as a very high level imterface for storing and retrieving persistent data for your driver. The persistence info is stored in the registry under the keys used to register the driver for the Chooser. All registry structure and API are hidden from the driver programmer.

<dt><b><a href="DriverHelperCLASSSerial.htm">DriverHelper.Serial</a></b>
<dd>Provides a high level interface to the serial (COM) port for drivers to use. Timeouts, low-level details of the serial port's operation, text ersus binary modes, etc. are hidden by a simple but effective object model. 

<dt><b><a href="DriverHelperCLASSUtil.htm">DriverHelper.Util</a></b>
<dd>A collection of useful methods for driver writers. Conversion of data from sexagesimal (HMS/DMS) to binary and back are provided, as well as timing functions, numeric formatting functions, and an interface to the Windows MessageBox feature (for script-based drivers). The sexagesimal functions are very flexible, capable of dealing with anything that remotely resembles sexagesimal, and producing a wide variety of sexagesimal outputs.

<dt><b><a href="DriverHelperCLASSTimer.htm">DriverHelper.Timer</a></b>
<dd>An object which will deliver periodic events (calls to your event handler procedure). You can turn it on and off, and control the interval between ticks. You can create multiple timers.
