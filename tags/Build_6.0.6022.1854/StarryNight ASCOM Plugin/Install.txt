ASCOM Telescope Plug-in for OLD Starry Night Pro
------------------------------------------------

NOTE: THIS PLUG-IN WORKS ONLY WITH STARRY NIGHT PRO (V3)

Before installing, verify that you have Starry Night Pro V3
or later. Run Starry Night, select About Starry Night from 
the Help menu, then look in the lower left corner of the 
about box for the version number.

To install the plug-in into Starry Night Pro:

(1) Copy AscomScope.plug into the Starry Night Pro Data\
Plug-ins subdirectory

Next time you start Starry Night, you'll see that a Telescope
menu has appeared on the menu bar. Make sure your scope is
powered up and connected to the serial port on your PC. Now 
you need to configure the plugin for your telescope type.

(1) Select Setup... in the Telescope menu. In the Telescope
Chooser, select the type of telescope you have. Some LX200
emulators will work with the Generic LX200 Type.

(2) Click Properties, and adjust the settings to your needs.
The most common sources of problems are:

    (a) Not knowing what COM port your telescope is connected
        to

    (b) Some other program (e.g., Palm HotSync) having the
        serial port allocated and open.

    (c) Bad cables

(3) Close the property window. Now the OK button is enabled.
Click OK.

(4) Select Connect in the Telescope menu. If all is well you
will see a crosshair showing where yor telescope is pointing.

IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE ABOVE,SELECT TELESCOPE SIMULATOR 
IN STEP 1 ABOVE. You can play with Starry Night Telescope 
support without even HAVING a telescope.

You may be able to update the time in your scope (depending
on whether your scope type supports it) using the Update
Time feature of the Telescope menu. Same with your geographic
location.

Right click on an object and note the Slew to... selection.
