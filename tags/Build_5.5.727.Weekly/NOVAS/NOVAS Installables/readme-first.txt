                             =============
                             NOVAS-COM 2.1
                             =============

Congratulations, you have successfully installed NOVAS-COM V2.1. The
next step is to look over the documentation, which is an HTML (web)
document. Unless you changed the default installation path, NOVAS-COM
is installed in the ASCOM common files area at:

  C:\Program Files\Common Files\ASCOM\NOVAS

and the HTML documentation is located in the Doc subdirectory from
there. Start your web browser and open the document "novas-com.html" in
that Doc subdirectory. 

You can check out the operation of NOVAS-COM V2 with provided test 
scripts. This is documented in the Introduction page of the online
help.

UNINSTALLING
------------

To remove NOVAS-COM from your system, open Add/Remove Programs in the
Control Panel, select NOVAS-COM V2 and click the Add/Remove button.
Choose "automatic" unless you are an advanced user.
