Summary of Changes
------------------
The changes fall into the following categories:

1. Change in the copyright status of the DAT routine.

2. Implementation of two new categories of routines, viz:

   a) There are three routines for the horizon/equatorial plane
       coordinates.

   b) There are six routines dealing with gnomonic (tangent plane)
       projections.

3. Due to introducing these new routines, The Astrometry Tools
   Cookbook, the test program and other supporting files have also
   been updated.

4. Other minor documentation/typographical corrections to various
   files.

FORTRAN Library
----------------

1    iau_DAT.for    Code now classified as "user-replaceable support
                    routine".  Thus the terms & conditions at the end
                    are also modified.
