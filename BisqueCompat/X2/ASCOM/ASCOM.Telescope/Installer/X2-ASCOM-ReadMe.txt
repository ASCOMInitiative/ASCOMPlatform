ASCOM Mount/Telescope Plugin for TheSky X
=========================================

This X2 driver/plugin allows you to control any mount/telescope that has an ASCOM driver. The plugin conforms to the Software Bisque X2 standard for device control. It provides a pathway from TheSky X to any ASCOM Telescope driver and its mount.


One-time Setup
--------------

1. Select ASCOM/Telescope Driver for the mount type (Mount Setup, Choose...)

2. Mount Setup, Settings... will open the usual ASCOM Chooser

3. Select your telescope type. Click Properties in the Chooser to configure the telescope.

4. Close the Chooser, and from there it's normal TheSky X operation.


Variable Capabilities
---------------------

Depending on the capabilities of the selected ASCOM mount/telescope, controls may or may not appear in TheSky X. For example, if the ASCOM mount does not support control of sidereal tracking (on/off), TheSky X's Telescope panel Tools popup menu will not contain the "Turn Sidereal Tracking On" or "Turn Tracking Off" items.


Reporting Problems

This plugin is not part of TheSky X. It was developed for the ASCOM Initiative by Bob Denny. The place to report problems and ask questions is in the ASCOM Talk group on Yahoo:
