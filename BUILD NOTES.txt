The 'Master Build' contains three significant Solution Configurations (targets):
1. Debug - builds components in debug mode
2. Release - builds components with optimization enabled
3. Platform Dependencies - builds the Platform Dependencies folder in debug mode.

Build Process
=============

The platform build is automatic and is currently performed by TeamCity build server.
Developers building locally on their workstations should use the Debug configuration
for most purposes.Please avoid building the Platform Dependencies configuration
locally, the dependencies are intended to be checked out fully-formed and used
'as-is'.

Platform Releases
=================

A platform release can be made by simply copying a tagged build from the
tags folder of the ASCOM SVN repository. The TeamCity build server will
have a build configuration that builds the entire platform and creates a
labelled build in the tags folder. This build process can be started from the
TeamCity web interface by any member of the Platform Release Managers group.

Platform Dependencies
=====================

The purpose of the Platform Dependencies folder is to provide a staging area
for the core components that driver and simulator developers may reference
during development. This is needed because those developers do not necessarily
have permission to access the entire SVN repository.

Building the Platform Dependencies target builds the core assemblies (in Debug
configuration) and copies the outputs to the Platform Dependencies folder, from
whence they may be committed to Subversion. Driver developers will pick up those
updates the next time they do an SVN Update.

** AVOID COMMITTING THE PLATFORM DEPENDENCIES FOLDER UNNECESSARILY **
Binaries do not compress well and tend to bloat the repository and will
ultimately start to affect performance if committed too often.The dependencies
folder is intended to represent a stable base platform for developers and should
be updated as infrequently as possible.

Driver and Simulator Development
================================

When developing a new driver or simulator, developers should reference components
in the Platform Dependencies folder. Do not reference components installed in the
Global Assembly Cache (GAC) - this makes your build non-portable and it will cause
the automated build to fail.

Driver and Simulator setup projects should NOT redistribute core components. The
Platform components will be installed in the GAC by the Platform Installer. The
driver/simulator will then automatically detect and use those components when
installed on the end-user system.

Please make sure that you exclude any core components from your setup project.
