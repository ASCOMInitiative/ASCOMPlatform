      	<hr>
      <p class="note">If you submit code to the ASCOM Source Code Repository, this licence 
          policy will apply to your submission. By submitting source code to the ASCOM 
          repository, you accept this policy and agree to abide by it. Once source code is 
          submitted to the ASCOM repository, it is placed in the public domain and cannot 
          be withdrawn, regardless of the license used. Therefore, if you do not wish your 
          source code to be placed in the public domain, do not submit it to the ASCOM 
          repository.</p>

      <h3>The ASCOM Platform License</h3>
        <p>The ASCOM Platform consists of all executables and their related source code, 
            content and media that are delivered as part of the ASCOM Platform Installer.</p>
        <p>As a rule of thumb, this includes (but is not limited to) everything referenced 
            in the ASCOM Platform Visual Studio Solution files: core components, driver 
            simulators, sample code, documentation and utilities.</p>
        <p>The Platform does not necessarily include device drivers submitted by independent 
            contributors.</p>
        <p>The ASCOM Initiative is a group of software developers and instrument vendors who 
            support and contribute to The ASCOM Platform. It is not a legal entity and does 
            not own or make money from The ASCOM Platform. It serves as a convenient way to 
            refer collectively to contributors of intellectual property, for attribution and 
            licensing purposes. </p>

        <h3>Device Drivers</h3>
        Device drivers submitted by independent authors are not part of the ASCOM Platform. However, contributors agree that upon submitting their source code to the ASCOM repository,
        that source code is placed in the Public Domain and cannot then be withdrawn from the ASCOM repository.<br />
        <br />
        Contributors are free to adopt their own licensing policy for code they submit, 
        but are strongly encouraged to adopt the <em>Creative Commons Attribution Share 
        Alike</em> license in line with the ASCOM Platform. If a different license is 
        used, then the submitter must clearly document it within the first submission 
        (and subsequent submissions) of their code to the ASCOM Repository.<br />
        <br />
        Source code that does not specify an alternative license and which is submitted 
        to the ASCOM repository shall be considered to be licensed under the same 
        license as the ASCOM Platform.<br />
        <br />
        <h3>Other Items</h3>
        All other items not covered above that have been submitted to the ASCOM Repository shall (unless indicated otherwise) be included under the ASCOM Platform License.
