<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the interface used by low-level telescope
"FilterWheel" components as part of the Astronomy Common Object Model (ASCOM).
Components that implement this interface can provide way for programs to
control various filter wheels via a standard set of properties and methods.</p>

<p>This specification covers a simple, low-level filter wheel control interface
for taking exposures, reading out the image, and accessing common functions
such as controlling the cooler. It does not provide for accessories such as
filter wheels. Those sorts of devices have their own interfaces. The
characteristics of this interface comply with the ASCOM Quality Guidelines,
assuring consistent behavior and compatibility with the widest possible variety
of Windows Automation clients.</p>

<p>For a summary of the changes and additions, please refer to the Release
Notes.</p>

<h2>Implementation and Conventions</h2>

<p>All of the methods and properties specified must be present in any
conforming driver's interface. However, some methods and properties may not
actually be implemented; they will raise a "not implemented" error when called
or accessed.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p> To control a particular filter wheel type, a program would create an
instance of the driver for that filter wheel type, then use the standard
properties and methods described in this document to effect control of that
filter wheel. Thus any program or script that uses the standard driver
interface automatically gains access to any filter wheel type for which a
driver exists. For more information on ASCOM, see the ASCOM Home Page.</p>
