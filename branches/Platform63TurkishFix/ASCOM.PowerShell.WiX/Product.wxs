          Step 1 - define the directory structure.
          NOTE: INSTALLLOCATION is referenced by the project references generated by WiX/Votive; it must be present for that feature to work correctly.
                This represents the application folder, usually in ProgramFiles. ProgramFilesFolder is a WiX predefined symbol.

    <!--
          Step 2 - define the components that make up the product. A component is an indivisible unit of installation
          and typically consists of a single file.
          In a 'longhand' WiX project, each component will be listed here, but an easier way is to let WiX/Votive generate
          these automatically by using project references. Other non-project content can be added here manually.
     -->

     <!--
            Step 3 - define the product's 'features' that can be installed
            We're using project references to pull in components (files) from the source projects.
