  This document specifies the ID-to-file mappings for all images that appear in conceptual documentation. 

  To include an image using MAML you must reference the image's ID instead of its file path.  The following
  example inserts an image with an ID of "myimage" into the documentation.
  
  <para>Here's an image:</para>
  <mediaLink>
    <image xlink:href="myimage" />
  </mediaLink>

  The following example can be used in this document to specify an image file for "myimage".
  
  <item id="myimage">
    <image file="image.jpg">
      <altText>Alternate text for the image.</altText>
    </image>
  </item>
  
  - The id attribute is not case-sensitive.
  - The image's file attribute is a name and path relative to at least one of the specified art link target
    input paths, which are found in your project's conceptual configuration files.  To reference artwork in 
    your project's Help\Art folder, simply specify the image's name without a path as in the example above.
  - The altText element is optional.
