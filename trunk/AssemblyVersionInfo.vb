' This file sets the assembly version for all generated assemblies.
' All projects in the build should reference this file by including the following
' in their project file:
'
'   <Compile Include="..\AssemblyVersionInfo.vb">
'     <Link>Properties\AssemblyVersionInfo.vb</Link>
'   </Compile>
'   <Compile Include="..\SolutionInfo.vb">
'     <Link>Properties\SolutionInfo.vb</Link>
'   </Compile>
' 
' Version information is isolated in a seperate file to facilitate integration with the build server.
' The build server will replace this entire file with a machine-generated one. Therefore,
' this file should contain ONLY the global version number and no other settings.
' 
' For local builds, the major and minor versions are fixed and the
' revision and build numbers are set automatically by Visual Studio.
