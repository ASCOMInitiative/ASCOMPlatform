        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          This namespace contains a class that provides easy access for .NET programs to device drivers. It handles differences 
          between device interface versions transparently so that the client does not need to be concerned about these and sees a 
          single cocnsistent interface to each device type.

        <p>
          This namespace contains private classes that are used internally within the ASCOM Platform, the platform installer and related items.
          Developers should not use any items defined in this namespace. The items defined here carry no guarantees and are subject to change
          at any time without notice, including the possibility of breaking changes. Use of this code is explicitly not supported.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to use code in this namespace, you may obtain a copy of the source code, either from the ASCOM Subversion repository, or
          by using .NET Reflector to reverse-engineer the code. You may then copy the source code to your own project. You then assume all
          responsibility for supporting the code.

        <h2>ASCOM.Conform Namespace</h2>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          This namespace contains the IConform interface and associated classes that enable drivers
          to tell Conform which commands to send through the CommandXXX functions and the expected 
          responses. The CommandXXX commands are of necessity hardware specific, hence this mechanic 
          to allow Conform to send valid commands.
