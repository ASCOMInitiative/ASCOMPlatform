                   Updates for SOFA Release 11 : 2015 February 2
                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Changes/updates fall into the following categories: 

1. A leap second at the end of June 2015, requires updates to the 
   iau_DAT (dat.for) and iauDat (dat.c) routines.
   
2. Introduction of two new routines, G2ICRS and ICRS2G (both Fortran 
   and C), creating a new category entitled "Galactic coordinates".

3. A few minor changes to a few routines to remove some compiler 
   warnings; (1) Changes in the test for zero in C2IXYZ, GC2GDE, RM2V, 
   RV2M, and multithread precaution in CAL2JD in the Fortan version only.

4. Updated test programs t_sofa_f.for and t_sofa_c.c.  Updated the 
   include header file sofa.h.
   
5. Documentation revision, moving the routines STARPV and PVSTAR 
   (category Star Space Motion) and PMSAFE and STARPM (category Star 
   Catalog Conversions) into Astrometry.  This results in the removal 
   of the category Star Space Motion.

Fortran:
--------

iau_C2IXYS   there was a test for zero that could potentially cause 
             compiler warnings.  The test has been changed.
             
iau_CAL2JD   a value in a DATA-initialized array was being changed
             during execution.  This had consequences for multi-thread
             code.  The algorithm has been changed to avoid the 
             difficulty.             
             
iau_DAT      a leap second is now required in UTC for 2015 June 30. 

iau_G2ICRS   transformation from Galactic Coordinates to ICRS.  A new 
             routine.

iau_GC2GDE   there was a test for zero that could potentially cause 
             compiler warnings.  The test has been changed.
             
iau_ICRS2G   transformation from ICRS to Galactic Coordinates.  A new
             routine.
             
iau_RM2V     there was a test for zero that could potentially cause 
             compiler warnings.  The test has been changed.

iau_RV2M     there was a test for zero that could potentially cause 
             compiler warnings.  The test has been changed.
             
t_sofa_f     program updated with the two new Galactic Coordinate 
             tansformations.

ANSI C:

iauC2ixys    there was a test for zero that could potentially cause 
             compiler warnings.  The test has been changed.
             
iauDat       a leap second is now required in UTC for 2015 June 30.

iauG2icrs    transformation from Galactic Coordinates to ICRS.  A new 
             routine.           

iauGc2gde    there was a test for zero that could potentially cause 
             compiler warnings.  The test has been changed.
             
iauIcrs2g    transformation from Galactic Coordinates to ICRS.  A new 
             routine.
             
iauRm2v      there was a test for zero that could potentially cause 
             compiler warnings.  The test has been changed.

iauRv2m      there was a test for zero that could potentially cause 
             compiler warnings.  The test has been changed.
        
sofa.h       addition of the new functions, removal of duplicate 
             functions.  All functions are listed in the categories 
             that are given on the website and in the manual.
             
t_sofa_c     program updated with the two new Galactic Coordinate 
             tansformations.

Documentation:
--------------

intro.lis    Minor change.

sofa_lib.lis New routines added.  The routines STARPV, PVSTA, PMSAFE and 
             STARPM into Astrometry. Category Star Space Motion deleted.
             This list harmonised with sofa.h and the website.

                   Updates for SOFA Release 11a : 2015 March 4
                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

This minor release (11a) contains a change to suppress a warning message 
given by one C compiler.  The change does not affect the behaviour of the 
routine and it is not essential that you update your libraries 
(particularly if you are a Fortran user).

The change had already been made in the 2014 September 9 (10c) release, 
but due to an oversight was not present in the current release.  The 
Fortran code has also been modified for harmony. 

Summary of Changes

iauDat      A change has been made to the ANSI C version to suppress 
            an array bounds warning produced by recent gcc versions.
            
iau_DAT     A change has been made to the Fortran version to ensure 
            equivalence between the Fortran and ANSI C versions.
