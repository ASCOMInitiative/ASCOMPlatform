<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The ASCOM Focuser Interface allows focusers from a variety of manufacturers to be connected in a standard way with different software applications. It provides an interface which is uniform and consistent, regardless of the actual hardware used.</p>

<p>The driver supports both absolute and relative focuser operation. Absolute focusers can be commanded to go to particular step position. Mechanically, the zero point may be the lowest position the focuser can be sent to, or it may be some arbitrary position configured by the user. Focusers that have absolute positioning capability are very useful when running autofocus algorithms.</p>

<p>Relative position focusers can also be used. Relative commands can be sent to the focuser to move it in or out a certain distance. Relative focusers are not expected to position in a precise fashion.</p>

<p>Any special features of a focuser that require special setup can be accommodated using a Setup dialog box, which can be opened by the host software. For example, maximum travel limits, setup for temperature compensation, etc., can be configured via a Setup dialog box.</p>
