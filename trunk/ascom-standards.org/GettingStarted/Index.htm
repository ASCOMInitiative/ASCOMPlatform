        <h3>
            What is a Driver?
        </h3>
        <p>Well, step back from astronomy for a minute. How would a word processing (WP) program
        	print? How many different printers are out there? It would be ridiculous for the
        	WP program to include support for the zillions of printers that are available now
        	and those that have been discontinued but are still in use. And what about the ones
        	that are yet to be released? Who has a crystal ball? Do you need a new release of
        	the WP program every time a new printer comes on the market. Forget it! &quot;Does
        	FancyWord support the MegaPage 631232 printer?&quot; Now add spreadsheets, paint
        	programs, photo processors, etc. to the mix. Would every one of these programs have
        	to be modified to support the MegaPage 631232 printer when it comes out? That&#39;s
        	really ridiculous! What&#39;s the solution? Drivers! All programs that need to print
        	are completely ignorant of printers. They hook into a standard interface that is
        	printer-agnostic. The drivers take care of the differences. When you select a printer
        	in Microsoft Word, you are selecting a driver. </p>
        <p>OK, back to astronomy. Until ASCOM,
        	astronomy programs that needed to control telescopes, focusers, and so forth had
        	to include code for all of the different instrument types out there. &quot;Does
        	BeautifulSky support the MammaJamma 300 mount?&quot; Same problem, just as ridiculous.
        	Programs that are ASCOM-compatible don&#39;t have to contain special code for these
        	devices. Instead, they rely on the drivers to handle the differences. If this revolution
        	in astronomy software appeals to you, go to the <a href="../Community/Advocacy.htm">ASCOM Advocacy</a> page now, and find
        	out how you can help make ASCOM become universally understood.</p>

            Current Projects</h3>
        The ASCOM Initiative currently has a number of projects underway (in no particular
        order):
        <ul>
            <li>Extension to include Microsoft .NET: Discussion underway. </li>
            <li>Weather Station driver standard: Dormant. </li>
        </ul></div><div class="article">
        <h3>
            Open Source vs Objects and Scripts
        </h3>
        <p>The objects-and-scripts approach has the advantages of Open Source and more. It
        	meets the Open Source goal of providing ways for users to tailor software to their
        	needs while assuring that the core services remain in a supported and defined state.
        	Many OpenSource programs are designed with one thing in mind, and then pounded into
        	another form by someone unrelated to the original developer. The result is often
        	a &quot;house that Jack built&quot; that only approximates the solution and is difficult
        	to understand and maintain. And there may be many variations on the original theme,
        	each of which is a separate code base. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, a developer who is proficient
        	in tool design has flexibility in mind from the outset. The software is designed
        	from the ground up to accomodate a wide variety of applications by 
        	exposing interfaces to its capabilities. By combining components and their 
        	objects, end users can build endless types of applications with relatively 
        	little code. Most of the core functionality is wrapped into the components, 
        	which are maintained and supported by their developers</p>
