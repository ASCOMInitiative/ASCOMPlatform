		<h3>Projects in Progress</h3>
		<h4>Software Bisque Compatibility</h4>
		<p>[<i>completed - Updated components available for <a href="../Downloads/Index.htm" target="_blank">download</a></i>] Components that allow Software Bisque's <a href="http://www.bisque.com/sc/" target="_blank">TheSky X</a> and <a href="http://www.bisque.com/sc/pages/thesky6family.aspx" target="_blank">TheSky 6</a> to use ASCOM drivers, and to act as an ASCOM Telescope driver. For more information on the two components and how they relate to TheSky and ASCOM see <a href="../FAQs/TheSky.htm" target="_blank">Working With TheSky</a>. This project adds compatibility with TheSky X, the newest version of the TheSky family.</p>
		<h4>ASCOM Camera Interface 2.0</h4>
		<p>[<i>completed, will be in Platform 6</i>] In Fall 2009, several camera manufacturers and astronomy image processing software developers met at the Advanced Imaging Conference in San Jose, CA to finalize the ASCOM Camera V2 interface. The device-independent handling of one-shot color imagers and their variety of Bayer matrix configurations had been the stumbling block. The group reached a compromize and the interface was finalized. Since then, implementation of  drivers has been done, as well as a Camera V2 simulator as well as a Camera exercise/test program. The latter tools will be part of the upcoming ASCOM Platform 6, as well as the V2 specification and .NET templates.</p>
		<h4>ASCOM Platform 6.0</h4>
<p>The next generation of the ASCOM Platform is aimed at adding the Camera V2 driver interface, and even more support for both drivers and astronomy applications. It will contain all new simulators, updated Visual Studio driver templates, a new settings provider for Visual Studio integraton of settings, and more. This &quot;mother of all projects in progress&quot; project is underway with several people working on it, and is expected to be out in beta late this year or early next year (2011).</p>
<p class="note">Please Note: Weekly online (LIveMeeting) meetings are held by the Platform development team. These are public. If you with to attend, contact Bob Denny <a href="mailto:rdenny@dc3.com">rdenny@dc3.com</a> or Tim Long  <a href="mailto:tim@tigranetworks.co.uk">tim@tigranetworks.co.uk</a> for the meeting ID etc.</p>
		<h4>Weather Safety Interface</h4>
<p>With the variety of weather stations out there, and their different interfaces, it seems natural that astronomy applications should have the benefit of a driver layer to make  weather safety information available without coding for every station out there. This project has become active, with Matt Thomas leading the way with an interface proposal. The present effort is aimed at providing safe/unsafe and basic sky condition inputs. Providing detailed meteorological information will be a separate project, as this is much more complex, and is not needed in support of active observing.</p>
		<h4>Switch Interface    </h4>
		<p>This driver interface provides device-independent access to switch closures. There are many types of electrical switch systems that can be controlled by computers, and they interface through a variety of hardware connections (serial link, ethernet, USB). Astronomy applications often to need to control power and other things via computer-controlled switches. A switch interface was proposed a few years ago, and a Switch simulator is included with the current ASCOM Platform. The interface was never formally adopted, it was recently decided to drop the existing Switch interface, which uses arrays in its interface, in favor of a new interface which uses a collection of Switch objects. This interface architecture is much more in line with modern practices. Expect this (and a new simulator) to appear in ASCOM Platform 6.</p>
