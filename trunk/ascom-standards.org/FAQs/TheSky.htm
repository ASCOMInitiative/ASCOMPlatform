		<h3>Working With TheSky&#8482;</h3>
		<p>Since TheSky by itself is not compatible with the ASCOM environment, we've provided some adapter components to make it fit in. There are two different ways that TheSky can fit into the ASCOM environment:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>TheSky can look like an ASCOM compatible telescope. This is mainly useful when the telescope is a Paramount, which requires TheSky as part of its control system. </li>
			<li>TheSky can bypass its internal telescope control logic and instead use an ASCOM driver. This is useful when controlling a telescope that is not supported internally within TheSky, but has an ASCOM driver. </li>
		</ol>
		<h4>1. TheSky Using its Internal Telescope Logic (e.g. Paramount)</h4>
		<p>In this case, ASCOM astronomy software selects <span class="underline">TheSky Controlled Telescope</span> as its telescope type. This makes TheSky, TPOINT, ProTrack, and its internal telescope control logic look like any other ASCOM telescope driver. See the text below the diagram for details. </p>
		<p align="center"><img src="../Images/TheSkyDriver.png" alt="Diagram" width="521" height="636" /></p>
			<p>This requires 
				TheSky 6 Professional (TheSky 5 Level IV is supported for backward compatibility). When using one of the many programs that control 
				telescopes via ASCOM drivers, you need to have the <a href="../Downloads/ScopeDrivers.htm">TheSky-Telescope driver</a> and select  &quot;TheSky Controlled 
				Telescope&quot; as the telescope type. Of course, within TheSky itself, 
				select your real telescope type (e.g. Paramount). This configuration 
				(using TheSky as a telescope controller) is not limited to the 
				Paramount; it can be used with any telescope type that can be controlled 
				from TheSky&#39;s internal telescope logic.
				<p>If you receive a &quot;permission denied&quot; message when trying to connect, 
					you need to enable TheSky&#39;s external control features:</p>
				<ol>
							<li>Start TheSky. </li>
					<li>In TheSky&#39;s Telescope menu, select Server Settings... </li>
					<li>In the Server Settings window, Remote client capabilities 
						section, turn on <i>all</i> of the options (&quot;allow&quot; checkboxes). </li>
					<li>Also turn on Remote clients use Orchestrate&#39;s &quot;ImageThenSlewTo&quot; 
						command. </li>
					<li>Click OK to close the Server Settings window. </li>
					<li>Now try connecting from your ASCOM astronomy program again. It 
						should work.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You need to do steps 2-5 only one time.</p>
				<h4>2. TheSky Controlling a Telescope With an ASCOM Driver</h4>
				<p>In this case, TheSky plays the role of an ASCOM astronomy program that uses ASCOM drivers like any other.  See the text below the diagram for details.</p>
				<p align="center"><img src="../Images/TeleAPI.png" alt="Diagram" width="444" height="425" /></p>
				<p>In order to use ASCOM drivers for telescope control from within 
				TheSky, you need to install the <a href="../Downloads/Plugins.htm">ASCOM &quot;TeleAPI&quot; plug-in</a>. Download, unzip and read 
				&#39;install.txt&#39;. This gives instructions on how to install the adapter. 
				After you have done this: </p>
				<ol>
						<li>Start TheSky </li>
				<li>In the Telescope menu, select Setup... TheSky's Telescope Setup 
					window will appear. </li>
				<li>Set the Telescope or control system name to <span class="underline">Telescope API</span>. </li>
				<li>Click Settings... to display the ASCOM Telescope Chooser </li>
				<li>Select your telescope type in the Chooser. </li>
				<li>Now click Properties... in the Chooser. Verify the settings for 
					your telescope type. </li>
				<li>Click OK in the Chooser. </li>
				<li>Click Close in Telescope Setup. </li>
				<li>Now, in TheSky&#39;s Telescope menu, select Link/Establish. You 
						should see the crosshairs indicating your telescope&#39;s current 
					position, and you now have telescope control in TheSky. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>You need to do steps 2-9 only one time (unless you change your telescope 
					type)</p>
