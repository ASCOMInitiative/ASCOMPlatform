ASCOM Camera Simulator

This will set up a camera simulator that is designed to implement the ASCOM camera interface.

It can implement V1 and V2 interfaces and most parameters can be controlled.

It can provide "real" data using an image as a source of data, in more detail:
The image can be anything that will deliver a colour bitmap, I suggest a JPG is good enough.
The image size should be the same as the CCD size.
The data read from the image will vary depending on the Sensor type, for a monochrome CCD it will read
the brightness but for colour sensors with a Bayer arrray will
extract the colour data using the sensor type and the Bayer offsets.

Noise can be added to the image, so can can dark current.  the noise, dark current and
image data is scaled according to the temperature and exposure time.

Most testing has been done on the monochrome data, there is quite likely to be problems with the
