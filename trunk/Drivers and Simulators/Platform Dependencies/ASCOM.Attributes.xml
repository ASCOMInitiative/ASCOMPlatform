            <summary>
            An attribute that confers a 'friendly name' on an assembly and marks it as loadable by LocalServer.
            The 'friendly name' is used by the ASCOM LocalServer to register the class with the ASCOM Chooser.
            The 'friendly name' is what gets displayed to the user in the driver selection combo box.
            This attribute is also used by the LocalServer to filter the assemblies that it will
            attempt to load at runtime. LocalServer will only load assemblies bearing this attribute.

        <member name="T:ASCOM.DeviceIdAttribute">
            <summary>
            An attribute for specifying an associated ASCOM DeviceID (aka COM ProgID).
            This is intended primarily for use with the ASCOM.SettingsProvider class.
            This attribute is placed on the driver's <c>Properties.Settings</c> class, which propagates
            down to each of the settings properties. When the setting is passed to the
            ASCOM.SettingsProvider class at runtime, the settings provider looks for this attribute
            to determine which settings hive to save the value in when it is passed to 
            <see cref="T:ASCOM.Utilities.Profile"/>.
