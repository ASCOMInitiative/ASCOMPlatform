	<h3>ASCOM General Requirements</h3>

	<p><i>Revised 31-Oct-2019</i></p>

	<p>In order to be called "ASCOM compliant", a driver or component must meet <i>all</i> of the <i>applicable</i> guidelines in this document. Only then may a driver, interface, or a component's packaging and user interface, carry the ASCOM logo.</p>
	<h2>Please Note: </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The technical details of some of the requirements here are automatically taken care of if you are developing in .NET and use the driver templates or the client toolkit, both of which are provided with the ASCOM Platform.</li>
		<li>The Platform includes a free tool for making driver installers which use the free Inno Setup package. </li>
		<li>This document does not yet cover the requirements for drivers and applications that use the new <a href="../Developer/Alpaca.htm" target="_new">ASCOM Alpaca infrastructure</a>. Please review the Drivers and Applications requirements and apply those that would apply to your Alpaca enabled device or app. <span class="underline">For ASCOM Alpaca, feel free to use the ASCOM Alpaca logo if your driver or application uses ASCOM Alpaca</span>.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Drivers</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>The driver <i>must</i> install and run on on Microsoft Windows 10, 8.1, 7, Vista, and XP with the latest service packs at the time of driver release, and with User Account Control enabled at its default/normal setting. It <i>should</i> work on both 32- and 64-bit systems.
			<span class="underline">Support for Windows 2000 is no longer provided</span>.</li>
		<li>The driver author must implement the published standard   for the device type as a <a href="../Developer/Binding.htm" target="_blank">late-bound COM interface</a>. The published standards are specific about the data types that are used for properties and method parameters. These data types (and COM itself) are what make drivers <a href="../About/CompatLang.htm" target="_blank">cross language compatible</a>. Note that by using a .NET language and the .NET driver templates we provide with the <a href="../Downloads/PlatDevComponents.htm" target="_blank">Platform Developer Components</a>, this is all taken care-of for you. Also see item 6 below.</li>
		<li>The driver <i>must never</i> &quot;extend&quot; the standard interface (add private members - properties and/or methods). If private members are desired, they <i>must</i> be exposed through a separate non-standard interface. Starting with Platform 6, driver authors can also extend their drivers through the new <tt><span style="color: #CF0">Action</span></tt> and <tt><span style="color: #CF0">SupportedActions</span></tt> members that are now common to all device interface standards.</li>
		<li>The driver <i>must never</i> display a modal window which requires user interaction to dismiss. All errors must be raised/thrown back to the client.</li>
		<li>The driver <i>must</i> use the   Profile's Register() method for ASCOM registration. It is recommended that drivers also use the Profile object for storage of their persistent configuration, state data, etc., as well as the  Serial object serial port I/O. for The  components are part of the ASCOM Platform and serve to isolate drivers from changes in Platform architecture. They also make development easier by providing high level functionality commonly needed by drivers.</li>
		<li>Prior to release, the driver <i>must</i> pass the Conform tests using the current/latest version of the <a href="../Developer/Conformance.htm">Conformance Checker</a> test tool. </li>
		<li>The driver <i>must</i> be delivered as a self-contained installer. It is unacceptable to ask users to copy files, edit the registry, run BAT files, etc. See <a href="../Developer/DriverDist.htm">Creating a Driver Installer</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Windows Components and Programs (not drivers)</h2>
	<ol>
	<li>The product must run (at a minimum) on Microsoft Windows 7 and 10, with the latest service packs at the time of driver release, and with User Account Control enabled at its default/normal setting.
	 It <i>should</i> work on both 32- and 64-bit systems. <span class="underline">Support for Windows XP or 2000 is no longer provided</span>.</li><li>The name ASCOM and/or the ASCOM logo must <i>never</i> be displayed for products which are in experimental, beta, preview, or any other such state. Only production products which are available and supported by the vendor or author are eligible.
	</li>
	 <li>Property and method names should be user friendly (e.g., SlewToCurrentObject instead of slw_curob). Use of so-called "Hungarian" notation is specifically discouraged. These interfaces may be used by script writers and should be user-friendly.
	</li><li>Wherever practical, property and method names should be consistent with existing ASCOM standard interfaces. For example, a property that implements equatorial right ascension should be called RightAscension, as used in the Telescope standard interface.</li>

	<li>The product <i>must</i> implement <b>scriptable dispatch</b> ("Automation") interface(s) via the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM), and use only automation-compatible data types (see the data type requirements below). </li><li>Errors within your product <i>must</i> raise Automation exceptions (via IErrorInfo). The error info <i>must</i> contain both an error number that is based on FACILITY_ITF and an informative error message in English and optionally other languages. Optionally, methods which do not return values should return VARIANT_BOOL indicating success or failure. This allows clients to determine status while ignoring exceptions (e.g. On Error Resume Next and try/catch). IErrorInfo support is essential to providing client writers with the behavior they rely on. Very few of these people manually test return values for errors with 'if' logic. They depend on their client environment to pop a meaningful alert box (or catch an exception with try/catch) when things go wrong.
	</li><li>Components must be 100% usable from an automation client without user interaction. For example, it is not permitted to require a user to dismiss an error alert window when the program is being controlled through a component automation interface. On the other hand, it is permitted to require the user to use a program's configuration features to set preferences. Another example of non-compliant behavior is a component server whose behavior changes or stops depending on whether it is a foreground or background window. The point of this requirement is to assure that, when used from a script, the program will never hang awaiting some user action such as a window shuffle, or clearing an error message box or selector dialog. Raise an exception and return to the client for handling the error or establishing the selection.
	</li>
	<li>The product must be delivered as a self-contained installer. It is unacceptable to ask users to copy files, edit the registry, etc. See <a href="../Developer/DriverDist.htm">Creating a Driver Installer</a>.</li>
	<li><span class="underline">Executable</span> components must self-register when first started, and must support the command line options /REGSERVER and /UNREGSERVER to manually register and unregister them. Invocation with either of these options must immediately exit and must not start the program. </li><li>Any executable component must start automatically if one of the objects it serves is created by a client. Furthermore, it must exit automatically when the last reference to any object it is serving is deleted. Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, an executable component <i>should</i> start in a minimized window. This is not a hard requirement as a component may benefit from displaying information as it operates. Unless this is the case, though, the component should remain out of sight (minimized) unless manually made visible by the user.
	</li></ol>

	<h2>Logo Usage</h2>
<p>If you have a driver or an astronomy product that conforms to these requirements, feel free to use the logo on your web site and product packaging, as long as you do the following:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>If you use the logo on a web site, please link it back to this site <a href="http://ascom-standards.org/index.htm">http://ascom-standards.org/</a>

	</li>
	<li>Post a note to <a href="https://ascomtalk.groups.io/g/Help" target="_new">ASCOM-Talk</a> indicating your product, company, and URL. The moderator or other responsible person will add you to the partners page and link to your web site. </li></ol>

Please  This is on the honor system, there are no contracts or other covenants required. Please don't undermine this effort by ASCOM-labeling software that doesn't meet the above requirements. Make the effort and your software will be better for it!
