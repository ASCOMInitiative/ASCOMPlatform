<p style="color:#FF9900;font-size: large;border: 2px solid; background: #222222">NOTE: Alpaca is 100% independent of Windows. Nowhere in the Alpaca ecosystem is Windows (or COM) needed. Please look over <a href="../About/Index.htm">About Alpaca and ASCOM</a> if you haven't yet.</p>
<h3>ASCOM Alpaca - ASCOM is not just for Windows any more</h3>
	<p>If you are new to ASCOM in general and plan to develop an ALpaca app or driver, <em>please</em> take the time to go through the <a href="../About/Index.htm">overview of ASCOM, Alpaca, and Classic ASCOM given in the About Ascom section here</a>. The video below goes through esesentially the same things. Hopefully one or the other will help you gain context.</p>

	The introduction of <a href="https://github.com/ASCOMInitiative/ASCOMRemote/releases" target="_new">ASCOM Remote</a> in 2018 began the process of extending the ASCOM ecosystem to include the internet, Linux, and MacOS, to include small embedded controllers like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. As of early 2019, this effort has grown into a new wave of development, with several astronomy instrument vendors embracing the implementation of the ASCOM Interfaces as ReST resources, reachable over the internet. Now known as ASCOM Alpaca, the next steps are being taken. This effort is much farther along that you might imagine. If you are interested in learning more, visit the ASCOM Alpaca page:</p>

<h3>Developer's Forum</h3>
	<p>In October 2018, we migrated to Groups.io for our forum/mail-list application. As part of this we opened two separate forums, one for users and the other for developers. As a developer, we ask that you seek help and information using the <a href="https://ascomtalk.groups.io/g/Developer" target="_new">ASCOM Talk Developers Forum</a>.</p>

	<h3>Driver Design Principles</h3>
	
	<p>The interface specifications aren't the full story! There are some design principles that, if adhered-to, will maximize the chances that your driver will operate properly with a variety of client software. See the <a href="../About/Characteristics.htm">About Alpaca and ASCOM, Section 5 Key Characteristics</a>
	<h3>Common Traps and Mistakes (mostly for Alpaca driver developers)</h3>
	<p>It probably seems unprofessional to start this section with what <i>not</i> to do, but we're just trying to save you time and pain. Over the last 12+ years we've seen the same mistakes repeated by driver developers enough times to rate being listed here. Hopefully a word to the wise is enough.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Not understanding the driver-client architecture and that your driver will be used by many applications, some of which don't  yet exist. See <a href="../About/Index.htm">About Alpaca and ASCOM</a>.</li>
		<li>Using sources for another driver (or worse, one of the simulators) as a starting point (you start with other peoples' mistakes and the wrong design)</li>
		<li>Exposing timing restrictions or other device quirks to driver clients (they don't want to do stuff just for your goofy device)</li>
		<li>I'm sure there are more</li>
