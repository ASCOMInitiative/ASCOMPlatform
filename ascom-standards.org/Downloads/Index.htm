		<p>This page lists items that the ASCOM Initiative has made available for download. <span class="underline">The ASCOM Platform is required for most of the drivers and other components</span>. It contains a set of common interfaces, engines, and tools that are used to support most ASCOM drivers and other components. The Platform installer also contains a  set of developer tools and documentation which may be <i>optionally </i> installed.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="article">
		<h3>Driver Downloads</h3>	
		<p>This is where you can get drivers for your astronomy instruments and devices. The links along the left side lead to the drivers for each device type.</p>
	<p>If you don't find a driver for your device here, <span class="underline">contact the manufacturer and inquire about availability of a driver</span>. An increasing number of manufacturers are shipping drivers with their hardware (see the <a href="../About/Projects.htm">Projects page</a>). If they don't have one, suggest to them that they have one developed, as it will greatly enhance the value of their product. See the <a href="../Community/Advocacy.htm">Advocacy page</a> for some suggestions in this regard. </p>

		<h3>Plug-in Downloads</h3>
		This is where you can get the plug-ins that allow programs such as TheSky and SkyMap Pro to connect to ASCOM Drivers.  
		Note that most programs that use astronomical devices already use ASCOM drivers and thus need no plug-ins.
		<h3>Platform Updates</h3>	
		<p>This is where you get updates to components that are included in the ASCOM Platform.
		
		</p><h3>Additional Downloads</h3>
		<p>These components are not drivers; they are engines that are primarily of interest to developers. Included are a scriptable positional astronomy engine based on the USNO NOVAS Vector Astrometry package, an orbit engine that can generate ephemerides from orbital elements, and a scriptable deep sky catalog server with over 70,000 object names listed.</p>
		
		<h3>Developer Downloads</h3>
		<p>The most useful item here (under <a href="DevTools.htm">Additional Tools</a>) is the <span class="underline">Conformance Checker</span> (written by Peter Simpson). This tool can be used to check many aspects of yor driver against the relevant ASCOM specification.</p>
		<p>Also, be sure to periodically check the <a href="PlatToolUpdates.htm">Platform Tools Updates</a> section. It has updates to the developer tools that come with the ASCOM Platform such as .NET templates, installer generator scripts, etc. </p>
		<h3>Older ASCOM Platform (4.1)</h3>
		<p>This older platform is for <span class="underline">Windows 2000 users only</span>! Do not install this in the hopes that some problem will be resolved. Work with us on the ASCOM-Talk list to resolve your problem. If, and only if, you are running Windows 2000, you can download and install the <a href="http://download.ascom-standards.org/ascom41.exe">ASCOM Platform 4.1</a>.</p>

		<p>Windows 2000 users <em>only</em>, install the <a href="http://download.ascom-standards.org/ascom41.exe">ASCOM Platform 4.1</a>. You will have very old drivers and you'll be unable to update most of them.</p>
