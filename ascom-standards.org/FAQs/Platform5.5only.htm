	<h3>My Driver can only install on Platform 5.5</h3>
	<p>Some driver
	installers check the platform version and report that they cannot be
	installed on Platform 6.  You get a message like this:</p>
	<p><IMG SRC="../Images/Platform5.5only.jpg" NAME="The ASCOm Platform 5 is required for this driver." BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
	<p>This happens
	because the driver installer is checking the platform version and
	only accepts platform 5 or 5.5.</p>
	<p>Platform 6 has
	a mechanism that will allow these drivers to be installed. When the
	installer asks for the platform version it checks the file name and
	if it's in the list of files that need Platform 5.5 it reports the
	version as 5.5.</p>


	<p>For most
	drivers this has been set up in the installer but there are some
	which we are not aware of that cannot be included.  In this case you
	can make the driver install by adding it's name to the list.  To do
	this:</p>
	<UL>
		<LI>Open the Profiler Explorer.</li>
		<LI>Go to the &ldquo;ForcePlatformVersion&rdquo; section.</li>
		<LI>Add the <span class="underline">exact</span> file name of the installer and set
 		the version to what's required, usually 5.5.</li>
		<LI>Go to the &ldquo;ForcePlatformVersionSeparator&rdquo;
		section and add the <span class="underline">exact</span> file name to the list.</li>
		<LI>Note that the <u>exact</U> file name is required. In some cases 
		the browser will change the installer file name  when
		it's downloaded.</li>
		<LI>An alternative is to rename the installer file to a name
		that is already in the ForcePlatformVersion list.</li>
	</UL>
		<p>Notes:</p>
	<UL>
		<LI>Please inform the driver author so he can
		update his installer. Installers generated using the current Platform 6 installer generator
		do not have this problem.</li>
		<LI>Inform the Platform 6 developers so we can add
		the driver to the list that's provided with the Platform 6
		installer.</li>
		<LI>NOTE. This mechanism is provided as a way to allow current
		and orphaned drivers to continue to work.  We will not add new
		driver installers to the list. The driver developer should update
		their installer so this mechanism is not needed.  The current
		driver installer generator does not have this problem.</li>
