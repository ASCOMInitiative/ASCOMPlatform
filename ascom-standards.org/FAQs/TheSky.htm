		<h3>Working With TheSky X&#8482; and TheSky 6&#8482;</h3>
		<p>Since TheSky X and TheSky 6 are themselves not 100% compatible with the ASCOM environment, we've provided some adapter components to make them fit in. </p>
		<p class="note">Please note: As of March 2013, Software Bisque's TheSky X includes built-in support for controlling devices through their ASCOM drivers. The description of the separate plug-ins that was here has been removed, as Software Bisque now provides access from TheSky X to all ASCOM devices. Please upgrade your copy of TheSky X to the latest version.</p>
		<p>There are three different ways that TheSky can fit into the ASCOM environment:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Both TheSky X and TheSky 6 can look like an ASCOM compatible telescope. This is mainly useful when the telescope is a Paramount, which requires TheSky (X or 6) as part of its control system. </li>
			<li>TheSky 6 can bypass its internal telescope control logic and instead use an ASCOM driver for the telescope/mount.</li>
			<li>TheSky X can use ASCOM based devices in addition to those for which it has internal interface logic. This requires no additional action or explanation.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4><a name="skydrvr" id="skydrvr"></a>1. TheSky Using its Internal Telescope Logic (e.g. Paramount) for an ASCOM speaking astronomy program</h4>
		<p>In this case, ASCOM astronomy software selects <span class="underline">TheSky Controlled Telescope</span> as its telescope type (this adapter driver is <a href="../Downloads/ScopeDrivers.htm">separately downloadable</a>). This makes TheSky (X and 6), TPOINT, ProTrack, and its internal telescope control logic look like any other ASCOM telescope driver. See the text below the diagram for details. </p>
		<p align="center"><img src="../Images/TheSkyDriver.png" alt="Diagram" width="521" height="636" /></p>
			<p>This requires 
				TheSky X or TheSky 6 Professional (TheSky 5 Level IV is supported for backward compatibility). When using one of the many programs that control 
				telescopes via ASCOM drivers, you need to have downloaded and installed the <a href="../Downloads/ScopeDrivers.htm">TheSky-Telescope driver</a> and select  &quot;TheSky Controlled 
				Telescope&quot; as the telescope type. Of course, within TheSky itself, 
				select your real telescope type (e.g. Paramount). This configuration 
				(using TheSky as a telescope controller) is not limited to the 
				Paramount; it can be used with any telescope type that can be controlled 
				from within TheSky (including ASCOM mounts as of March 2013 with TheSky X).<h5>One Time Setup: TheSky X Professional</h5>
				<p>All that's needed is to activate TheSky X scripting support, normally only required on Vista or Windows 7:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Locate TheSkyX.exe (normally in Program Files or Program Files (x86), Software Bisque, TheSky X Professional). </li>
					<li>Right click and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong></li>
					<li>Answer Yes to the &quot;are you sure&quot; security popup</li>
					<li>Wait until TheSky X starts up completely</li>
					<li>Exit and restart TheSky normally.</li>
				</ol>
<h5>One Time Setup: TheSky 6 Professional</h5>
				<p>You need to enable TheSky&#39;s external control features:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Start TheSky 6 Professional. </li>
					<li>In TheSky&#39;s Telescope menu, select Server Settings... </li>
					<li>In the Server Settings window, Remote client capabilities 
						section, turn on <i>all</i> of the options (&quot;allow&quot; checkboxes). </li>
					<li>Also turn on Remote clients use Orchestrate&#39;s &quot;ImageThenSlewTo&quot; 
						command. </li>
					<li>Click OK to close the Server Settings window. </li>
					<li>Now try connecting from your ASCOM astronomy program again. It 
						should work.</li>
				</ol>
		<h4><a name="teleapi" id="teleapi"></a>2. TheSky 6 Controlling a Telescope With an ASCOM Driver</h4>
		<p>In this case, TheSky 6 plays the role of an ASCOM astronomy program that uses ASCOM drivers like any other.  See the text below the diagram for details.</p>
				<p align="center"><img src="../Images/TeleAPI.png" alt="Diagram" width="444" height="425" /></p>
				<p>In order to use ASCOM drivers for telescope control from within 
				TheSky, you need to install the <a href="../Downloads/Plugins.htm">ASCOM &quot;TeleAPI&quot; plug-in</a>. Download, unzip and read 
				&#39;install.txt&#39;. This gives instructions on how to install the adapter. 
				After you have done this: </p>
				<ol>
						<li>Start TheSky </li>
				<li>In the Telescope menu, select Setup... TheSky's Telescope Setup 
					window will appear. </li>
				<li>Set the Telescope or control system name to <span class="underline">Telescope API</span>. </li>
				<li>Click Settings... to display the ASCOM Telescope Chooser </li>
				<li>Select your telescope type in the Chooser. </li>
				<li>Now click Properties... in the Chooser. Verify the settings for 
					your telescope type. </li>
				<li>Click OK in the Chooser. </li>
				<li>Click Close in Telescope Setup. </li>
				<li>Now, in TheSky&#39;s Telescope menu, select Link/Establish. You 
						should see the crosshairs indicating your telescope&#39;s current 
					position, and you now have telescope control in TheSky. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>You need to do steps 2-9 only one time (unless you change your telescope 
					type)</p>
