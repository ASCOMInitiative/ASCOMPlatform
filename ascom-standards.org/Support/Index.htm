		<h3>Getting Help - Up Front</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Communicate with us on the <a href="https://ascomtalk.groups.io/g/Help/" target="_new">ASCOM Talk Help Forum</a></li>
			<li>Keep in mind that &quot;ASCOM&quot; and the &quot;ASCOM Platform&quot; is a set of documentation, tools, and libraries used by many developers. It is not a &quot;program&quot; that is causing your problem. </li>
			<li>Uninstalling and reinstalling the ASCOM Platform or a program you are struggling with is almost always a waste of time. </li>
			<li>The problems we see most commonly are with devices, and are most often caused by flaky cables, bad USB connectors, bad power supplies for devices, or other hardware and driver related issues. The device maker, driver author, and people here who try to help need a way to make the problem happen reproduceably. Divide and conquer is another concept to consider. </li>
			<li>There are no gremlins living in computers and devices. The causes of problems can virtually always be explained logically. Give the developers and others who want to help a chance to focus on the problem and solve it. </li>
		</ul>

	<h3>General Advice - If You Ask Us for Help</h3>
		<p>Communicate with us on the <a href="https://ascomtalk.groups.io/g/Help/" target="_new">ASCOM Talk Help Forum</a>. Remember that we aren't looking over your shoulder; we can't see things that are totally obvious to you. We need to know:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What brand of device (e.g. telescope and mount) you are
				using.</li>
			<li>What driver you have selected, including its version. Are you running the latest version?</li>
			<li>What application you are using. Is it up to date?</li>
			<li>What operating system you are using, including the release number etc. Is it up to date?</li>
			<li>Exactly what you did, what worked and what did not.</li>
			<li>An exact reproduction of any error messages, with what was done just before the error happened.</li>
			<li>Ideally an exact sequence of actions that will generate the error (repro scenario). </li>
			<li>Any log files produced by the application and/or the driver. You might look at them first. </li>
		</ul>
