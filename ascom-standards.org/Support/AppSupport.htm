<h3>How to Get Support - Applications</h3>
<p>Applications use ASCOM's universal interfaces to communicate with various devices. If you're having trouble connecting to or using a device from one of your applications, it's either a problem with the device or its driver, or your application has a bug. Nine times out of ten it's the device, its driver, the cables, power supply etc. Here's how to tell where the problem is (and avoid finger pointing). </p>
<ol>
	<li>Using the Chooser, select the ASCOM simulator for the device with which you're having trouble.</li>
	<li>In the Chooser, Properties... if needed set the device simulator to mimic your real one as needed.</li>
	<li>Connect to the problem device (now the Simulator)</li>
	<li>Try to reproduce the problem.</li>
	</ol>
<p>If you no longer see the problem, then you know to a high degree of confidence that the problem is not a bug in your application. It probably isn't anyway or the app developer would have loads of others complaining of the problem besides you. Instead, you have a device problem. <a href="DeviceSupport.htm">Now go here to see how to deal with device problems</a>.</p>
<p>If the problem persists with the simulator, then it is a problem in the application. The good news is that you have already done one thing the app developer would have asked you do to, eliminate the device as the problem. You can now give the application developer a set of steps and condtions to reproduce the problem (he too will have the simulated device). If the application produces a log file, be sure to save that along with the repro scenario. From here, work with the app developer to solve the problem.</p>
