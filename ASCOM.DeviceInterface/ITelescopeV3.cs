		/// <remarks>
		/// <para>For historical reasons, this property's name does not reflect its true meaning. The name will not be changed (so as to preserve
		/// compatibility), but the meaning has since become clear. All conventional mounts have two pointing states for a given equatorial (sky) position.
		/// Mechanical limitations often make it impossible for the mount to position the optics at given HA/Dec in one of the two pointing
		/// states, but there are places where the same point can be reached sensibly in both pointing states (e.g. near the pole and
		/// close to the meridian). In order to understand these pointing states, consider the following (thanks to Patrick Wallace for this info):</para>
		/// <para>All conventional telescope mounts have two axes nominally at right angles. For an equatorial, the longitude axis is mechanical
		/// hour angle and the latitude axis is mechanical declination. Sky coordinates and mechanical coordinates are two completely separate arenas.
		/// This becomes rather more obvious if your mount is an altaz, but it's still true for an equatorial. Both mount axes can in principle
		/// move over a range of 360 deg. This is distinct from sky HA/Dec, where Dec is limited to a 180 deg range (+90 to -90).  Apart from
		/// practical limitations, any point in the sky can be seen in two mechanical orientations. To get from one to the other the HA axis
		/// is moved 180 deg and the Dec axis is moved through the pole a distance twice the sky codeclination (90 - sky declination).</para>
		/// <para>Mechanical zero HA/Dec will be one of the two ways of pointing at the intersection of the celestial equator and the local meridian.
		/// In order to support Dome slaving, where it is important to know which side of the pier the mount is actually on, ASCOM has adopted the
		/// convention that the Normal pointing state will be the state where a German Equatorial mount is on the East side of the pier, looking West, with the
		/// counterweights below the optical assembly and that <see cref="PierSide.pierEast"></see> will represent this pointing state.</para>
		/// <para>Move your scope to this position and consider the two mechanical encoders zeroed. The two pointing states are, then:
		/// <list type="table">
		/// <item><term><b>Normal (<see cref="PierSide.pierEast"></see>)</b></term><description>Where the mechanical Dec is in the range -90 deg to +90 deg</description></item>
		/// <item><term><b>Beyond the pole (<see cref="PierSide.pierWest"></see>)</b></term><description>Where the mechanical Dec is in the range -180 deg to -90 deg or +90 deg to +180 deg.</description></item>
		/// </list>
		/// </para>
		/// <para>"Side of pier" is a "consequence" of the former definition, not something fundamental.
		/// Apart from mechanical interference, the telescope can move from one side of the pier to the other without the mechanical Dec
		/// having changed: you could track Polaris forever with the telescope moving from west of pier to east of pier or vice versa every 12h.
		/// Thus, "side of pier" is, in general, not a useful term (except perhaps in a loose, descriptive, explanatory sense).
		/// All this applies to a fork mount just as much as to a GEM, and it would be wrong to make the "beyond pole" state illegal for the
		/// former. Your mount may not be able to get there if your camera hits the fork, but it's possible on some mounts. Whether this is useful
		/// depends on whether you're in Hawaii or Finland.</para>
