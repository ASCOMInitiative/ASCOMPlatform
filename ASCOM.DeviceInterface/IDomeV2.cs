		// [TPL][ToDo] Discuss park operation, which has different semantics for domes compared to other interfaces.
		// The purpose of Park and Unpark in other interfaces is:
		// Park should "shut down the equipment and make it safe for storage".
		// Unpark should "start up the equipment and make it ready for use".
		// 
		// A number of existing dome implementations automatically close the shutter when told
		// to park, because (for example) this engages a battery charger to recharge the shutter battery. This is
		// consistent with the normal semantics of "shutting down for storage" and in my opinion is already the
		// _de facto_ implementation for domes.
		// Suggest bringing this into line with the telescope definition of park and unpark in a future interface version
		// such that it is clear what parking means and that unparking is necessary for a parked device.
