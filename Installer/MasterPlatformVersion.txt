When version numbers are constructed by the installer the number of GIT commits is added as the fourth version number component
giving an overall format of MajorVersion.MinorVersion.ServicePack.GitCommitCount

This file is physically located at: YourCheckoutDirectory\Installer\MasterPlatformVersion.txt
and is included as content in the installer itself, where it is read at install time on the user's machine to provide appropriate
values to place in the Profile store. 

The file is also used at build time to set the InstallAware product version number, which is displayed when the installer executable 
is right clicked and the details tab is selected.
