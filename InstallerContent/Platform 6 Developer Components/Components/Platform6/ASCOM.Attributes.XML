        <member name="T:ASCOM.DeviceIdAttribute">
            <summary>
              An attribute for declaratively associating an assembly, class or property with an 
              ASCOM device ID (and optionally, a display name).
            </summary>
            <remarks>
              This attribute is intended for use in two main situations:
              <list type = "number">
                <item>
                  <term>
                    Settings management and integration with Visual Studio designers
                  </term>
                  <description>
                    When this attribute is placed on the driver's <c>Properties.Settings</c> class, it  propagates
                    down to each of the settings properties. When the setting is passed to the 
                    <c>ASCOM.SettingsProvider</c> class at runtime, the settings provider looks for this attribute
                    to determine which settings hive to save the value in when it is passed to 
                    <see cref = "T:ASCOM.Utilities.Profile" />.

                  </term>
                  <description>
                    The values in this attribute could be used by an installer custom action to perform
                    ASCOM registration during setup. Historically this has been handled programmatically,
                    but there are trends towards a more declarative approach to deployment (for example
                    WiX, Windows Installer Xml). It is expected that such an installer may need to obtain
                    registration data by reflecting on the assemblies being installed. Placing this attribute
                    at the assembly level will assist in this situation.

            <summary>
              An attribute that confers a 'friendly name' on a class and marks it as loadable by LocalServer.
              The 'friendly name' is used by the ASCOM LocalServer to register the class with the ASCOM Chooser.
              The 'friendly name' is what gets displayed to the user in the driver selection combo box.
              This attribute is also used by the LocalServer to filter the assemblies that it will
              attempt to load at runtime. LocalServer will only load classes bearing this attribute.
