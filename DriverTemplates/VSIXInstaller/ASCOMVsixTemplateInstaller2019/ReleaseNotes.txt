This Release
The local server template name been changed from LocalServer to ASCOM Driver

Release 6.6.3713
To conform with the ASCOM SafetyMonitor device specification the SafetyMonitor driver template now defaults IsSafe to False when the driver is not connected.
Local server drivers are the most effective way to deliver drivers because they provide built-in "hub" functionality and isolate the driver from the application by running it in a separate process.
The local server template is now much easier to use than in past templates and in consequence all in-process driver templates have been removed from this release.
