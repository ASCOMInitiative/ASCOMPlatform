	    <introduction>
	    	<para>There are small disparities between time as measured by the motion of the earth and time as measured by atomic clocks, which can lead to mount pointing inaccuracy if not corrected. 
	      	One of these effects is due to the earth's daily rotational period becoming longer as the earth's rotation slows down; this effect is about 1ms per day at the time of writing.
	      	</para>
	      	<para>
	      	Astronomers use two corrections to compensate for this effect:
	      	<list class="bullet">
				<listItem>Leap seconds - Introduced whenever required to keep Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), which is based on atomic time, within +-0.9 seconds of earth rotational time</listItem>
				<listItem>Delta UT1 - The remaining difference between UTC and earth rotational time on any particular day (in the range +-0.9 seconds) .</listItem>
			</list>
			At the present time, leap seconds need to be introduced every two to three years and the intention to change the number of leap seconds is published in the 
			International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) Bulletin C about 6 months in advance of the effective date. Predictions of Delta UT1 are published daily by the IERS Rapid Service 
			and include values for 90 days in advance of the current date.
	    	</para>
	        <para>Previous Platforms have contained a built-in value for leap seconds, current at the time the installer was built. However, they lacked an easy mechanism to update the leap second value 
	        and contained no support for the current Delta UT1 value.
	        </para>
	        <para>
	        The Platform now has the capability to automatically download current and future leap second values and current Delta UT1 values from the Internet on a regular basis so that the Platform will not 
	        need to be refreshed on observatory PCs when leap seconds change. If an Internet connection is not available, current values for leap second and Delta UT1 can be entered manually through a graphical 
	        interface. These options are described in more detail below.
	        </para>

			<para>
	        A graphical user interface for managing leap second and Delta UT1 vales has been added to the Diagnostics application that can be found in the Start / ASCOM Platform 6 folder. 
	        The Earth Rotation Data management graphical interface can be found in the Diagnostics Tools menu. On installation automatic update is selected, if you want a manual or no update mode then please use 
	        the tool to select your desired data source.
	        </para>
	        <para>
	        Five data sources are supported:

			<para>
			A variety of NASA and USNO sites distribute the IERS data and these can be selected from the Internet Data Source dropdown. To protect against waiting for ever for a download to complete, 
			a timeout can be specified, after which the download task will abort. A trace file can be turned on for on demand and automatic Internet updates. These log files will appear as:
