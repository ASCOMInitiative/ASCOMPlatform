	      			<listItem>The Dome control panel now uses DestinationSideOfPier when determining the dome position for slews</listItem>
					<listItem>The Camera simulator can now simulate cameras that are unable to operate at all intermediate Bin values 
					between 1 and BinMax.</listItem>
					<listItem>Small installer updates to recognise Windows 8</listItem>
					<listItem>The number of UTC leap seconds is now specified in the Astrometry key of the ASCOM Profile and can be updated by the user
					whenever additional leap seconds are added without requiring an ASCOM Platform release. The value set by this Platform update takes 
					account of the leap second introduced at the end of June 2012; no further change is expected to be required until 2014 or 2015.</listItem>
					<listItem>The Telescope Simulator .NET is now more representative of real German equatorial mounts by tracking 1 hour beyond 
					the meridian before flipping.</listItem>

	      			<listItem>Added a new AstroUtils.Event method that provides rise and set times for Sun, Moon and the planets. In addition, the times
	      			of Civil, Nautical and Astronomical twilight can be returned. Returned values are generally within 1 minute of those retured by 
	      			the

					for latitudes in the range 80N to 80S and within 5 minutes outside these latitudes. The returned event list can handle days 
					when no, one or two rise or set events occur.</listItem>
					<listItem>An alamanc program has been added to the Code Examples in the the Developer Components install. This generates a
	      			year long almanac for any AstroUtils.Event event at a given latitude, longitude and timezone.</listItem>
	     			<listItem>Added Chris Rowland's "Introduction to developing ASCOM drivers" to the developer install.</listItem>
					<listItem>Improved all drivers created through the template wizard. These now pass Conform "out of the box"
					and throw the correct ASCOM execptions instead of system exceptions. Comments have been improved and all
					CanXXX capability properties return boolean values instead of exceptions.</listItem>
					<listItem>The Inno installer template generator now creates installers that can uninstall earlier versions of themselves
					when a new version is installed.</listItem>
					<listItem>Transform
			      		<list class="bullet">
			      			<listItem>Upgraded from using NOVAS 2 components to using NOVAS 3.1 components internally. There is no external 
			      			functional change, accuracy is slightly improved</listItem>
			      			<listItem>The Refresh method is no longer required, values are always refreshed before presenting to 
			      			the calling application. The Refresh method is retained for backwards compatibility but its 
			      			use is now deprecated.</listItem>
			      			<listItem>A new Transform.JulianDateTT method has been added to allow the ephemeris time to be explicitly 
			      			specified. When this is done, Transform will no longer use the PC clock to calculate the Terrestrial Time, 
			      			instead, the supplied Terrestrial Time Julian date will be used. Transform's default behaviour is to use 
			      			the PC clock and this behaviour can be restored after JulianDateTT has been used by setting a JulianDateTT 
			      			value of 0.0.</listItem>
	  					</list>
					</listItem>
					<listItem>Astrometry - The DeltaT function has been augmented to predict values in line with earth observations to March 2013 and 
					the function now returns extrapolated values from April 2013 to December 2016. Taking account of USNO published uncertainty and 
					model fitting error, returned values are expected to be accurate to ±0.1sec in 2013, ±0.2sec in 2014, ±0.4sec in 2015 and ±0.7sec in 2016.</listItem>
					<listItem>The Terrestrial Time functions now account for the leap second that was introduced at the end of June 2012</listItem>
					<listItem> AstroUtils
						<list class="bullet">
			     			<listItem>Added new methods AstroUtil.MoonIllumination and AstroUtil.MoonPhase.</listItem>
							<listItem>AstroUtils.JulianDateTT and AstroUtils.JulianDateUT1 will now use an internal approximation for DeltaUT1
							if the supplied value is 0.0.</listItem>
							<listItem>Added a new function AstroUtils.FormatJD to format a Julian date using a supplied format descriptor.
							This function will primarily be of interest to those using scripting languages that lack this capability.</listItem>
						</list>
					</listItem>
					<listItem>An independent trace option for NOVAS components has been added to the Trace menu. Currently only a few
					NOVAS 3.1 functions create trace output.</listItem>
					<listItem>NOVASCOM.Planet now supports major planet numbers of 10=Sun and 11=Moon in line with the NOVAS convention.</listItem>
					<listItem>A new entry on time scale relationships has been added to the Developer Information section of the help file.</listItem>
					<listItem>TraceLogger - added a new single parameter initialiser that selects automatic file name generation based on the 
					supplied filetype parameter and immediately enables the logger, removing the need for a subsequent TraceLogger.Enabled = true; statement.</listItem>
					<listItem>Improved help description for the Focuser.Connected method saying that it is not available in 
					focusers built to the IFocuser version 1 interface</listItem>
					<listItem>Added a set of scripting language code samples to developer documentation to illustrate access 
					through COM.</listItem>
					<listItem>Descriptions of the new ICameraV2 methods have been clarified and now indicate whether the method must be
					implemented or whether it is persmissible for it to throw a NotImplemented exception.</listItem>
					<listItem>The Camera.PulseGuide description now specifies that the duration of movment should be expressed in 
					milli-seconds.</listItem>
					<listItem>The ASCOM convention for SideOfPier has be re-confirmed: that PierSide.pierEast, for a German
					equatorial mount, is the pointing state where the mount is on the East side of the pier, looking West, with the 
					counterweights below the optical assembly. This definition was lost from the SideOfPier and PierSide descriptions when the pointing state
					text was added in the original Platform 6 release.</listItem>

					<listItem>AstroUtils trace was permanently wired on, it now respects the Trace switch</listItem>
					<listItem>Transform computation accuracy has been improved for J2000 to Topocentric and reciprocal conversions.</listItem>
					<listItem>Transform now always returns up to date values when result values are repeatedly read without changing 
					input values e.g. when reading Azimuth or Elevation without changing the J2000 RA and Dec values. </listItem>
					<listItem>Astrometry.NOVASCOM.Planet now produces accurate values when the DeltaT property is set.</listItem>
					<listItem>Astrometry.NOVASCOM.Planet - fixed a marshalling issue that prevented use from scripting languages 
					through COM interop.</listItem>
					<listItem>Astrometry.Kepler.Ephemeris - fixed an initialisation issue in that prevented calculation for minor 
					planet bodies.</listItem>
					<listItem>Fixed occasional installation failures due to the presence of non-standard permissions in the registry</listItem>
					<listItem>DriverAccess, when used within an ASCOM client, now correctly handles hubs where DriverAccess has been used to present another driver. 
					i.e. DriverAccess now recognises situations where it has already wrapped a driver response and removes that wrapping before processing it again.</listItem>

						<list class="bullet">
							<listItem>Fixed a bug in the NOVAS 3.1 SideralTime function that appeared only when when the CIO method was selected</listItem>
							<listItem>The original NOVAS source code contained a bug in EphemClose that prevented the ephemeris file from being reopened; 
							a work round had already been incorporated in previous Platform releases. This has now been replaced with the official 
							fix from the NOVAS team.</listItem>

					<listItem>The components in the Astrometry.NOVAS namespace are fully usable from .NET languages but are not fully 
					accessible through COM from scripting languages because a number of parameters are passed by reference or use 
					structures that do not pass across the COM interface. Three workrounds have been established:
		      			<list class="bullet">
							<listItem><legacyBold>Recommended</legacyBold> - Use the Transform component in the ASCOM.Astrometry.Transform 
							namespace, it is fully COM compatible.</listItem>
							<listItem><legacyBold>Recommended</legacyBold> - Use the NOVASCOM components in the Astrometry.NOVASCOM namespace,
							they are also fully COM compatible.</listItem>
							<listItem>Create your own COM presentation component that encapsulates the NOVAS 3.1 functions that you require
							and presents them in a COM compatible fashion to suit your needs. This component can them be consumed by your 
							scripting application.</listItem>

 		 			<listItem>The NOVASCOM component iterfaces are now exposed as COM late binding interfaces only, early binding support 
 		 			has been removed. Exposure of early binding COM interop interfaces was unintentional; the core ASCOM team decided 
 		 			to revert to late binding for all interfaces in the original Platform 6 release. This has no impact on use of the
 		 			.NET components or use from scripting languages.</listItem>
