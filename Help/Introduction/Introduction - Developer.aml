			<title>Introduction</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					Platform 7 builds on the architectural changes introduced in Platform 6 with a strong new focus on asynchronous operation.
					Many Platform 6 interface operations were already explicitly documented as asynchronous and had associated pollable completion properties. Platform 7 ensures that all
					potentially long running operations are now defined as asynchronous and have associated completion properties.
				</para>
				<para>
					Some new asynchronous methods and completion properties have been introduced where these were missing from the Platform 6 interface definitions.
					See the Key Interface Changes section below for details.
				</para>
				<para>
					With the introduction of fully asynchronous operation, ASCOM is introducing a 1 second target time for completion of asynchronous operation initiation.
					Of course, the overall operation can take as long as required, it is just the initiation that has a target time. Our interface conformance checker Conform Universal
					can provide a full timing analysis so you can check how long interface methods take to complete.
				</para>
				<para>

			<title>Connect, Disconnect and Connecting</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					Connecting to drivers and Alpaca devices has always been effected through the Connected property (Focuser.Link aside), which operates synchronously. For Platform 7 we
					have introduced an asynchronous connection mechanic for all interfaces to accommodate devices with longer startup times. This operates similarly to other
					ASCOM asynchronous methods with an initiator: Connect() or Disconnect(), which must return quickly after stating hardware and software initialisation, and
					a completion property: Connecting that clients can poll regularly to determine when the process completes or errors.
				</para>
				<para>
					Drivers and Alpaca devices that implement Platform 7 interfaces must implement the asynchronous connection mechanic as well as supporting the Connected
					mechanic for backward compatibility with earlier clients.
				</para>
				<para>
					For the most reliable operation, clients should always check the device's interface version and use the new asynchronous connection mechanic if the device supports it.

			<title>Telescope Slewing</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					The Telescope interface has several methods that are specifically defined as operating synchronously, which can be problematic for COM applications and that are
					unreliable over network connections for Alpaca clients.
				</para>
				<para>
					Further detail on new implementation requirements for COM clients and drivers and Alpaca clients and devices is
					set out here: <link xlink:href="c37349a5-a535-47d6-8c30-11c620932213">Synchronous and Asynchronous Telescope Slewing</link>.

		<section address="Device-State">
			<title>DeviceState Property</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					Every interface now includes a DeviceState property that returns all the device's <legacyBold>operational</legacyBold> state in a single call. This has been introduced
					to reduce the number of polling calls required to monitor the device's operational state. A property is considered Operational if it can change during normal
					operation e.g a mount's right ascension and declination while slewing. Properties like telescope site latitude are excluded because their values 
					do not change during operation.
				</para>
				<para>
					Keeping the number of properties to a manageable size was considered important to improve response time and reduce loading on low power devices and to avoid creating
					large network responses that could cause issues on slower links. The table below shows the properties that are returned for each device type. The TimeStamp value is
					the time at which the device state was determined, if known, in ISO 8601 format.

								Driver authors must implement both the synchronous and asynchronous slew methods when programmatic slewing is supported.
								The synchronous methods must be implemented to ensure backward compatibility with older clients. A consequence of this is that the CanSlew and CanSlewAsync properties
